        I'm Emmett Speed (he/they), an enthusiastic advocate for enhancing math education and a Ph.D. candidate in Educational Neuroscience from Utah State University (defending 5/19/2025). I have over 10 years of experience in educational research and program management.</p>
      <p>  
        My research focuses on numerical cognition within linguistically and culturally diverse communities, with a focus on how language and culture shape mathematical learning, particularly among Indigenous populations. This work has allowed me to explore various facets of education, including policy, curriculum analysis, assessment, learning theory, and neurobiology. My dissertation, "The SNARC Effect in Mayan Numerals: Effects of Language Transparency and Reading Direction on Novel Symbolic Number Understanding", involved teaching the Mayan number system to investigate the impact of unfamiliar numerical systems on cognitive processing.
      </p>
      <p>
      Beyond research, I have practical experience in program management and data analysis. As the Program Manager - Data and Evaluation Lead at the Utah STEM Action Center, I led initiatives like the AmeriCorps Math Mentor Program, contributing to significant positive impacts on children's lives. I have a proven track record of developing databases, streamlining workflow, managing research projects, and securing grant funding. My colleagues know me as a "spreadsheet wizard" with a knack for problem-solving and a collaborative spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        My skill set includes quantitative data analysis, statistical software proficiency (R, Excel & Sheets, Tableau, SQL), project management, curriculum development, and educational assessment. I am passionate about making a difference in education and am committed to using my research and practical skills to create more effective and equitable learning experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I volunteer with Habitat for Humanity and the International Rescue Committee, play Dungeons & Dragons, cross-stitch lots of floral patterns, watch Star Trek: Deep Space Nine over and over again, and spend as much time as possible on a snowboard.
      </p>
