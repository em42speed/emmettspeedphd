      <h1 id="title">What is the Chol Q'ij?</h1>
        <p>The Chol Q’ij is the sacred 260 day calendar of the Maya people in the Highlands of Guatemala. Chol Q’ij is K’iche for “count of days”; it is also called the Tzolk’in in Yucateco. It can also be referred to as the “Highland Sacred Round”.</p>
        <p>The Chol Q’ij is often envisioned as two gears moving together, one of twenty “named” days and one of thirteen accompanying numbers. The first day of the cycle is 8 B’atz (celebrated as a secondary “New Year”), the second is 9 E’, the third is 10 Aj, and so on, so that each of the 260 days has its own unique combination of a number and day name.</p>

            <img src="images/chol qij.png" alt="Two gears labeled with the thirteen numbers and twenty day names. The arrows on each indicate they are rotating together."/>
            <figcaption>The Chol Q'ij numbers and day names, envisioned as gears.</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p> The 20 day names are <strong style="color: hsl(248.3, 92%, 24.5%)">Imox, Iq', Aq'ab'al, K'at, Kan, Kame, Kej, Q'anil, Toj, Tz'i', B'atz', E', Aj, I'x, Tz'ikin, Ajmaq, No'j, Tijax, Kawoq, and Ajpu.</strong></p>
        <p>In the Chol Q’ij, each of the twenty named days has a personality or character that is tempered or strengthened by the number of the day. According to Tedlock’s (1992) informants, low numbers (1-3) are gentle and indicate something young or new, and the high numbers (11-13) are powerful or violent, indicating more serious or “older” matters, but each number has layers of unique meaning beyond this. </p>
        <p>Initiated priests in this three-thousand-year-old tradition, called <em>ajq’ija’</em> or “day-keepers” (singular <em>aj q’ij</em>), interpret each date of the Chol Q’ij calendar and determine which rituals or prayers to perform; the community members that continue to follow the old ways request dream interpretations, divinations regarding their futures, interpretations of the will of the spirits and ancestors, and advice on good days to hold weddings, plant crops, or start a new business (Molesky-Poz, 2006; Tedlock, 1992). </p>
        <p>12 No’j, for example, is the best day to propose or defend a project. As the last even number before a beginning a new cycle, 12 represents a summing up of one’s actions and experience, and No’j is the best day to join ideas, give advice, or cultivate science (Anonymous, <em>aj q’ij</em>, Kaqchikel Maya of Patzún, Chimaltenango, Guatemala, personal communication, April 2016).</p>
        <p>The Chol Q’ij also holds astrological value on an individual level. Much like the Western concept of astrology, children are said to develop certain personalities and characteristics depending on the day that they were born. However, unlike Western astrology, this is not based on the location of the planets in certain quadrants of the sky at the moment of birth, but rather the confluence of the energies and rhythms of Mayan time that converge at the moment of conception and manifest at the moment of birth. </p>
        <p>For instance, children born on the day 9 No’j would be innovative thinkers, patient, curious, self-sufficient, and idealistic about justice, but stubborn and independent to a fault (Tedlock, 1992; Barrios, 2015). Most people in the highlands of Guatemala know their Chol Q’ij birthday and that of their children; many children are given traditional Maya names based on their birthday. These energies are concieved of as a guide or <em>ruwäch q'ij</em> ("the heart of the day") that for those who permit themselves to know it can give meaning to life and become a profound influence. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Ruwäch Q'ij</h2>
            <p>Mesoamerican traditionalists believe that the personality traits indicated by one’s birth date on the Chol Q’ij are embodied in a kindred animal spirit that accompanies, protects, and guides a person through life (García et al., 2009; Gonzalez, 2011; Shea, 2001). According to Gonzalez (2011), those who subscribe to this idea generally believe that the human and their animal counterpart share a soul, though cultural groups disagree on whether the animal is a physical entity, a metaphor, or a literal spirit that accompanies the person through their life. This animal, called the <em>ruwäch q’ij</em> (the heart of the day) in Kaqchikel or the nahual in Nahuatl, embodies their personality, their occupation, and their destiny. 
            <p>"The nahual or <em>ruwäch q’ij</em> ("the heart or fruit of the day") can be understood as a gift, mission, vocation, or innate quality that you bring with you at your birth to help you. That is today, accepting the mission enters a person into correspondence and compatibility with the universe. The service of the gift given to you by nature blesses you with much satisfaction in your life, permits you to achieve the function that you possess, and understand that each person is a small but complementary part of the universe." (pg 225, Ruxe’el Mayab’ K’aslemal. Raiz espiritu del conocimiento maya, translation mine). </p>
            <p>To know the identity of <em>ruwäch aq’ij</em> (the heart of <em>your</em> day) is taken as tacit acceptance of the mission set by it, and to accept the mission is to begin to walk the path that the gods and ancestors have laid out for you and to be blessed with satisfaction in your life. (García et al., 2009). The Kaqchikel believe that all the world has a <em>ruwäch q’ij</em> but only certain people are privileged to identify its species. </p>
            <p>Each of the 20 day names on the Chol Q'ij corresponds to at least one unique animal; some days have a variety, to allow for personality and personal choice. The nature of one’s <em>ruwäch q’ij</em> and thus one’s soul is to be kept secret; however, traditional Mayan names give away the nature of the <em>ruwäch q’ij</em> (such as Wuqu’ I’x having a jaguar, or Ixkame an owl) to those who are “in the know'' such as elders and daykeepers. In some areas, it is believed that those that know the form of <em>ruwäch kiq’ij</em> (the face of their day) may be able to take its form and shapeshift, flying like a bird, leaping over barriers, or performing tasks that would not be possible in human form (Shea, 2001).</p>
            <p>Whether the animal is literal or spirit, it is thought possible to physically interact with it and even to harm it if you know its name. Those who believe this version know that when something bad happens to the <em>ruwäch q’ij</em>, there is a corresponding repercussion for their human. As such, elders and community members keep the identity of the <em>ruwäch q’ij</em> a secret from a child until they are older. This also serves the benefit of keeping children from imitating their animal spirits artificially so that they instead will develop traits and characteristics naturally. Accordingly, “an individual may be aggressive or passive, nervous or calm, outgoing or shy, flamboyant or retiring, mischievous or serious, graceful or clumsy, all depending on the nature of the animal spirit (Shea, 2001; pg 55)”.</p>

                    <h3>1 Jun</h3>
                    <p>The number 1 in the Chol Q'ij often signifies <strong>beginnings, unity, and potent focus</strong>. It is the spark of creation, the initial impulse from which all else unfolds.</p>
                    <p>Consider it a day for initiating new projects, clarifying intentions, and standing independently in your purpose.</p>
                    <h4>Key Themes for Jun:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unity</li>
                        <li>Initiation</li>
                        <li>Potential</li>
                        <li>Originality</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Position</h4>
                    <p>Jun is a low and odd number, which usually represents something challenging. However, the seed can grow into a mighty tree, it is full of potential. It needs the correct nutrients and conditions to germinate and develop its potential. We also may need encouragement to develop our ideas.</p>
                    <p>Daykeepers usually do rituals on a 1 day, and in some traditional communities there is a special shrine dedicated to the number 1.</p>
                    <h4>Effect</h4>
                    <p>Trustful and independent. Do not expect a jun person to be bothered with the details or to bring the final touch to things. The Jun is more efficient when confronted with a challenge.</p>
                `,
                2: `
                    <h3>2 Ka'i'</h3>
                    <p>Ka'i' brings themes of <strong>duality, partnership, and important choices</strong>. It highlights relationships, cooperation, and the balance of opposing forces.</p>
                    <p>This day may ask you to consider different perspectives or to work collaboratively. Decisions made on a '2' day can have significant relational impacts.</p>
                    <h4>Key Themes for Ka'i'</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Duality</li>
                        <li>Partnership</li>

                        <li>Cooperation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Position</h4>
                    <p>Although a low number, it has surprising strength. It is said to be able to call upon both aspects or polarities of what it is attached to. It is said to be the number of lovers, it signifies relationships and self-sacrifice.</p>
                    <h4>Effect</h4>
                    <p>The energy of ka’i’ is to always consider the positive from the negative and to progress in a well balanced way through the different choices to be made, light/darkness, male/female, right/wrong, Yin/Yang. The energy of ka’i’ finds its reason to be by experimenting with differences. Whilst it can lend itself to mediation, seeing both sides of the story, it also can be indecisive.</p>

                    <h3>3: Oxi'</h3>
                    <p>Oxi' relates to <strong>rhythm, action, and the sacred hearth or home</strong>. It signifies creative expression, movement, and the coming together of energies.</p>
                    <p>Oxi’ represents the 3 hearthstones of the Maya home, on the fire supporting the tortilla griddle. From an astronomical point of view, the stones are the stars Alnitak, Saiph and Rigel in the constellation we call Orion, and the Smoky Fireplace is the Great Orion Nebula (M42). The Number 3 relates to the three worlds of the Mayan cosmovision – Heaven, Earth, and the Underworld.</p>
                    <p>It's a dynamic number that can bring activity and the need for clear communication within family or groups.</p>
                    <h4>Key Themes for Oxi'</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Action and rhythm</li>
                        <li>Home</li>
                        <li>Germination</li>

                        <li>Communication</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Position</h4>
                    <p>The number 3 is still in the low end of the range of numbers. It does not have much energy yet, and it is also an odd number.</p>
                    <h4>Effect</h4>
                    <p>it lacks stability and can represent challenges and obstructions. The number three brings up internal/external dilemmas. The lack of stability in the physical, external world that it brings suggests that the more appropriate action is to look to the internal world, both of the home and yourself.</p> 
                    <p>The energy of oxi’ is very eloquent through all forms of personal expression. The communication purpose is to establish a consensus between any point A and any point B. Since the basic movement is vibration, the oxi’ person is in the very core of the rhythm; often agitated, movement being their very nature. By working closely to the energy of the 3, anyone can foretell whatever movement. But 3 can be a difficult number nevertheless. Carl Jung, objecting to the notion of a Trinity, said that the number 3 is incomplete. The Maya would agree. This is a difficult number, and implies doubt, risk, uncertainty. Many traditional Daykeepers avoid initiating new projects on a 3 day.</p>

                    <h3>4: Kaji'</h3>
                    <p>Kaji' represents <strong>stability, foundation, and the four cardinal directions or pillars</strong>. It is a number of order, structure, and practical manifestation.</p>
                    <p>Four represents the cardinal points, the four colours of maize, the four carriers of the year, the two equinoxes and two solstices, as well as midnight, sunrise, midday and sunset. These four components of each day, each “sun,” can be conceptually expanded to include the solstices and equinoxes; thus the year is also a 4. There is evidence that the Classic Maya divided the universe into four sections marked by the two intersections of the Milky Way with the ecliptic. Thus we live in a fourfold universe. The Maya still lay out their ritual altars in a fourfold pattern. The number four is representative of the four first men. It was said to be they who raised the sky from the sea to create the world we live in. In Mayan myth it is four pillars that support the sky from the Earth. As you can imagine, kaji’ is a number which represents stability, a good, down-to-Earth number.</p>
                    <p>A day for building, organizing, and attending to the material aspects of life.</p>

                    <p>Wo'o is often associated with <strong>empowerment, the center, and the human hand (work and action)</strong>. It's a pivotal number that can represent the core of a matter or the application of will.</p>
                    <p>Wo’o’ is the four cardinal directions plus the center point. The Sacred Mayan calendar is said to be a calendar of human life. It can be seen as a microcosm of the human body. The number five is one of these parts. It is representative of the hand with its five digits. It is with our hands that we work, and with what we earn we pay our debts, so this is the number of work, the actions that we perform in life. Wo’o’ is also a number that relates to the sacred fire where we pay our debts with offerings and prayers.</p>
                    <p>This day can be for taking charge, focusing energy, and accomplishing tasks.</p>

Wo’o’ is an intelligent force that organizes communications, materials, knowledge and their application. By nature the wo’o’ people deal with networks and gather what they need. These persons go straight to the crux of any situation which makes excellent investigators out of them.</p>

                                <p>The day sign Imox carries profound significance related to the origins of life and the inherent energies of the universe. According to Molesky-Poz (2006), Imox symbolizes the material beginning of existence, encompassing both earthly life and the individual's internal journey. It's associated with "craziness," not as mental illness, but as a state of possession or an excessive focus on minute details. Furthermore, Imox is linked to the occult forces of the universe and necessitates humility before Mam, the Earth Lord. In essence, this interpretation emphasizes Imox as a primordial force tied to the physical inception of life and the enigmatic powers that govern the cosmos.</p>
                                <p>Stanzione (2006) presents Imox as the "First Mother," a vital feminine principle deeply intertwined with water and regeneration. Imox resides where the sky and earth merge with the ocean, particularly in the saline environments of mangroves and estuaries filled with water lilies. Symbolized by both the water lily and a canoe-tipping caiman, Imox embodies the Spirit of Rain and Water. This entity's "massive dismembered body" is the source of diverse life forms on Earth, thriving in "fertile" and "fecund" places abundant with various creatures. Imox represents the "wetness" from which life originates, the female sex, and the feminine principle, making it the first day of both the Long Count Cycle and the twenty-day divinatory calendar round—a source of life, mother energy, primal waters, blood, nurturance, and abundance. This perspective elevates Imox to a foundational and generative force, essential for both physical life and the emergence of Mesoamerican civilization.</p>
                                <p>Barrios (2015) interprets Imox as a day favorable for enhancing mental receptivity and spiritual strength. It drives the energies of change, allowing individuals to plan their life's steps and capture nature's messages. Imox is connected to intuition, perception, dream revelations, and the "Left Hand Path," aiding in the development of dormant feelings and signifying the essence of unspoken emotions. Imox embodies the subtle aspects of humanity, including sensitivity, the unusual, and the eccentric, distinguishing it from established norms. It represents a form of "craziness" that is not mental illness but rather something strange and bizarre. This view highlights Imox as an energy of personal growth, transformation, and the exploration of unconventional or hidden aspects of being.</p>

                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Imox are naturally intuitive and often provide insightful advice. They possess sharp mental agility, readily perceive and interpret subtle messages from their environment, and exhibit strong creative and productive tendencies. Furthermore, they have a genuine desire to assist others. Those born under Imox frequently experience good fortune, which they are inclined to share. They hold a deep concern for the well-being of their community and are capable of pursuing ambitious endeavors that others might find daunting. Due to their inherent spiritual understanding, they often serve as guides for others on a spiritual path.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>People born under Imox can be prone to indecisiveness, insecurity, and doubt, occasionally manifesting as violent or dishonest behavior. They may encounter challenges in romantic relationships, potentially becoming overly dependent, jealous, or possessive.

Without achieving inner balance, they risk developing a cruel or sarcastic demeanor.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“In divination for an illness, Imox indicates that an enemy has asked for the illness; the lower the number, the less serious the illness. As an early result in a marriage divination, Imox means the desired [partner] would cause the client to become crazy; through their unfaithfulness or other malicious actions, they would dominate the client. In divining for a journal or a business deal, Imox indicates so many problems and so much complexity that one would become crazy.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                                <p>“In divination for an illness, Ik indicates that the client has an enemy against him (<em>contra  culel</em>) who induced a rage (<em>eyawarinak</em>) or frenzy (<em>chuj</em>) within him. The result was illness. The lower the number, the more recent the rage and the less serious the resulting illness. In a marriage divination, Ik is a negative answer, indicating that the woman named is an enemy (<em>culel</em>), since she is too passionate and emotional (<em>lawalo</em>) and will bring frenzy (<em>chuj</em>) and destruction to the home and family. Ik is such a bad day for a journey or business deal that most Momostecan merchants will avoid transactions altogether on high-numbered Ik days.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                                <p>“Ik is such a dangerous Mam that the usual ceremonies for the current Mam are performed only on 1, 6, and 8 Ik during an Ik year. On these days, priest-shamans ask that they, their families, and clients not be crushed by the violence of Ik. They specifically ask that lightning, earthquake, flood, or landslide not destroy their homes, themselves, or their domestic animals. They also ask that the strong negative human emotions of hatred, anger, rage (<em>eyawarinak</em>), and frenzy (<em>chuj</em>) not fall upon themselves, their family, or their clients. A powerful and evil daykeeper or ajnawal mesa uses a high-numbered Ik to induce these negative, destructive rages, in nature as well as in humans. On such days, people may be dominated to some degree by violent passions, no matter how hard they try not to be.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                                <p>“When the day Akabal appears in a divination, the diviner must select from the three mnemonics and their ritual associations a coherent but inspired answer to the client's question. For example, if 1, 8, or 9 Akabal should appear in divining why a person is ill, the diviner will explore with the client (if the client is a member of his own patrilineage) the possibility that a family member fought with him or spoke ill of him behind his back on one of the days of the lineage rituals. If, however, the diviner is from another patrilineage, he will explore whether or not the priest-shaman of the client's own patrilineage who might even be the client's own father, brother, or uncle had reason to complain about him before the Mundo. Was the client not giving money to this priest shaman? Or did he drunkenly abuse the priest-shaman or his wife, sister, or daughter?, and so forth.</p>
                                <p>If the question concerns whether or not a specific woman will marry the client, and an Akabal of any number 1 through 9 appears first, then the answer is yes. If the assembled priest-shamans of a patrilineage, a canton, or the entire town are divining whether a particular person should fill a vacancy in their ranks and if a great majority, if not all of them, arrive at Akabal on the first round, then the answer is yes. If the question concerns whether a particular journey should be undertaken and the first answer is either a low or middle-numbered Akabal *, then the answer is yes, the road is open. But if the result is 10, 11, 12, or 13 Akabal, the answer is no: there is something hidden in the road. The high number calls attention to the negative aspect of Akabal.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“On 1, 8, and 9 Akabal *, the teacher of a new priest-shaman performs an opening ritual (<em>cabal*</em>) for the shrines of his student's patrilineage; he cleans out all the ashes accumulated by the student's predecessor. During the days on which lineage rituals were performed at these shrines, any ill feelings voiced within the patrilineage entered the shrine, which as a "little volcano" connected with all other volcanoes and mountains, placed these words directly before the Mundo. This is the source of the mnemonic <em>chakabaj*</em> ("tricks, lies, slander, and blame"); the removal of the ashes starts the initiate out with a clean slate or rather, a clean hearth. Also on Akabal, a young man and his family plan his marriage, first approaching the Mundo through the agency of his lineage priest-shaman, who will open (<em>cabal</em>) the lineage shrines on 1 Akabal, and then on 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 Akabal approaching the girl's family. This approach is usually made in early dawn, hence the mnemonic <em>akabil*</em> ("at dawn"). An Akabal day is also chosen to introduce (through prayer) a new baby to the ancestors at the lineage shrine.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“When the day Cat appears in divination, the diviner has a pretty good idea that, regardless of the question, the client is somehow lacking in his duties to the Mundo or ancestors, or else in the everyday social world. The number that proceeds Cat then indicates how recent this debt is and (consequently) how serious.</p>
                                <p>For example, 3 Cat * indicates a fairly recent and inconsequential debt, while 10 Cat indicates <em>nimalaj casaj*</em> (a large, old, serious debt or quantity of debts). As the diviner says, the client "is carrying a heavy net bag or suitcase." In order to cancel these debts, the client must give the priest-shaman nets full or heaps (<em>pa cat*, pa chim</em>) of copal, which will then be offered in their name to the Mundo and the ancestors.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“During the two consecutive years when Cat is Secretary for example, in 1975 and 1976 great stacks of offerings are given on 1, 6, 8, and 9 Cat in order to make up for any neglect of duties to the Mundo or the ancestors. At this time, people also take care of monetary, work, or other debts, both within the immediate family and at the local stores. The verb <em>catic</em> besides meaning "to burn," carries the metaphorical meaning that a married person is committing adultery with a virgin of either sex, expressed in full by the idiom <em>catic rakan</em>, "to burn their leg." This sort of sexual misconduct is a serious offense before the Mundo, who places the person "in debt" (<em>casaj</em>); if the debt is not cancelled, it will bring illness and even death to the offender.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                                <p>“When Can appears in a divination, the diviner immediately asks the client who his enemy (<em>ri culel</em>) could be. He may then explore the possibility that an ajmesa might have been hired by this enemy to send illness or death. If the client is already ill, the diviner will help the client to determine which ajmesa was hired to work against him; then he will help him choose a different, but equally powerful, ajmesa to defend him before the Mundo. If the divination concerns marriage, a business deal, or the selection of a religious leader, the day Can means that the woman, business associate, or priest-shaman in question is an enemy (<em>ri culel *</em>) or may become one, and all plans should be dropped immediately.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“Can is associated with the actions of a calendar diviner who has been trained as an ajmesa, or ajnawal mesa. These practitioners are simultaneously the most successful curers and a source of serious illness and death. Because of their power, some patrilineages in Momostenango have even selected an ajmesa as their patrilineage priest-shaman. On Can days with high numbers 11, 12, 13 these powerful diviners visit the sacred mountains of Momostenango and even distant volcanoes, speaking directly to the Mundo in order to cause or cure specific illnesses according to the desires of their patrilineage members or private clients. On low-numbered Can days for example, 1, 6, and 8 diviners who are not ajmesa petition the Mundo not to allow the latter to send illnesses to their lineage, their clients, or themselves. On 9 Can, ajmesa come from several Quiché municipalities to the foot of a high waterfall near San Cristóbal Totonicapán, known as "Nine Chairs Nine Tables" (<em>Belejeb Silla Belejeb Mesa</em>). There they first sweep (<em>caban mes</em>) the shrines ("chair" shrines are small individual shrines and "table" shrines are large public shrines) and then sacrifice chickens in order to cure illnesses sent to their clients by witches from the coast and from the municipality of Cobán. The ajmesa may use both middle and high-numbered Can days in order to conduct séances, during which the Mundo speaks directly through him or her to the client.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

Since money, business, and travel are considered analogous to spouses, the question as to whether or not to take a particular trip or make a particular business deal is answered affirmatively when Came appears. At this moment, the diviner might say, <em>Camej lal mayij tokob*</em> ("There is a favor"). The amount of the favor depends upon the size of the number, with 13 Came representing a tremendous success or a great fortune. However, if the divination concerns the cause of an illness, 13 Came could mean that a very long dead (<em>camical</em>) member of the client's own patrilineage sent the illness, and that the client probably will not recover.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“On 1 and 8 Came, permission days for the divining seeds, a priest-shaman who has a student burns copal at the earth shrines. He requests tranquility among his students, himself, and all deceased diviners, as well as between himself and his own divining equipment, and between himself and all other members, both living and dead, of his own patrilineage. Low-numbered Came days are also used for marriage proposals, as well as for the indigenous marriage ceremony itself. Since marriage (<em>culanem</em>), which is an important alliance between the living members of different patrilineages, is also an alliance between dead (<em>camical</em>) family members of both patrilineages, these dead kin must be in accord or else they will send trouble, illness, and even death into the new home. On 11 Came, the town priest-shaman from Los Cipréses visits Pipil, the sacred mountain of the north, in order to ask for tranquility between women and men, indigenes and ladinos, the people of Guatemala and the government of Guatemala, and between the nation of Guatemala and all other nations of the world.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                                <p>“In divination, the day Quej points to a calendar diviner of some type. For example, if a group of priest-shamans of a patrilineage, a canton, or the entire town are divining in order to fill a vacancy in their ranks, and a middle or high-numbered Quej arrives on the first round, then they have found the proper candidate. If the question concerns the cause of an illness and the day Quej appears, the diviner has "mounted" the patient by sending the illness into him. If the illness is a serious one, the diviner who was hired by the patient (or by his family) may begin a series of 9 or 13 consecutive rituals (one each day) in which he will "mount" the evil diviner in order to return the illness to its source.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“Because of the strength of Quej, there are many individual, clan, canton, and town rituals performed by <em>chawanel</em> ("talkers"[meaning the priest-shamans]), on this day. A Quej day  is always selected for the October and January meetings of the town elders. On 1 and 8 Quej, which are the most important permission days for new calendar diviners, the priest-shaman goes to the shrines and informs the Mundo of the name of any novice he is going to present on the upcoming 8 Batz*. On 6 and 7 Quej, the "broom" (<em>mesebal</em>) ritual is performed at the lineage shrine called the winel. At this time, the lineage priest-shaman cleans the three parts of the winel, first the low part, then the high part, and finally the center (<em>cux*</em>, literally "heart"), also called sacramenta. Then, depending on whether it is planting or harvest time, he symbolically "plants" and prays for a good crop, or else he symbolically "cuts'' and gives thanks for the harvest. If 8 Quej falls soon after planting, then the town priest-shaman visits Quilaja, the sacred mountain of the east, to ask for rain for the new crop; on 11 Quej, he begins his regular circuit of all four sacred mountains by going to Quilaja. On 1, 2, 3, or 4 Quej, the unborn children of the currently pregnant wives of the patrilineage are "sown" and "planted" (<em>awexibal ticbal</em>) in the "foundation shrine" (<em>warabalja</em>) by the lineage priest-shaman.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

On these days, the lineage priest-shaman, depending on whether planting or harvest time is closer, passes seeds saved from the previous year, or else fresh corn ears that have been chosen as seed ears for the next year, through the copal smoke. In so doing, he is symbolically feeding (<em>tzukunic</em>) both the Mundo and his own ancestors. Thus, one name for the priest-shaman is feeder (tzukunel).” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

If the client is ill, this means that the pain (<em>cäx</em>) is a punishment for this debt; the only way to cure it is to pay (<em>tojonic</em>) the Mundo, ancestors, or creditor what is owed, plus a penalty for the neglect. Since the number is low, the person will recover after paying. A middle-numbered Toj such as 7, 8, or 9 Toj indicates that someone in the client's family will die, and, as a consequence, the client will have to borrow money to hold the proper sort of wake. The day 13 Toj indicates that an ajmesa <em>lokej* ri camical, lokej ri sachical, lokej ri mac</em> ("cries for death, cries for disappearance, cries for sin") for the client. This is a serious matter that the diviner will turn over to an ajmesa, who will begin counter-witchcraft rites for the patient.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                                <p>“On 1, 6, and 8 Toj, individual diviners visit the community shrines Paja* (on 1), Paclom (6), and Chuti* Sabal (8), in order to make up for any one, six, or eight days missed since the opening of the cycle of obligatory shrine visits on 1, 6, and 8 Quej. At this time, they burn all the copal and candles they have omitted plus a penalty for having not made the offerings on the proper days. Since these Toj days are each the thirteenth occurrence of an obligatory day of a given number, they are extremely powerful days for both evil and good. At Nima Sabal, 9 Toj is reserved for lineage priest-shamans. If a lineage priest-shaman should neglect his duties on these Toj days, particularly on 9 Toj, someone in his patrilineage would suffer serious punishment in the form of an illness or injury (cäx) from the Mundo.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

This indicates that the person wants to do something one minute and does not want to do it the next. The person is uncertain and discouraged. A middle-numbered Tzi indicates that the novice has dirtied (<em>tzilonic</em>) him or herself by making love on one of the permission days, or else that a man and woman are exchanging jealous words (<em>tziyalaj tzij</em>) because of a lack of faithfulness on one or the other's part. A high-numbered Tzi indicates that the person has committed a serious sexual sin (<em>tzilonic</em>) such as incest, adultery, or sodomy. In a divination for a marriage, Tzi indicates that the woman already has a lover; consequently, all plans for marriage are stopped. No business deal or journey would be initiated on Tzi, which is a weak, indifferent day. (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

On this crucial day, the novice is formally quizzed about their recent dreams, and the teacher tells any of his own; the latter will then make his final decision as to whether or not to go ahead with the initiation. He asks if the novice has lost confidence (<em>catziyaric</em>), or is willing to go through with the initiation. When he has assured himself that the novice is decisive, he immediately begins the initiation ritual, which will be publicly completed on the next two days, 8 Batz and 9 E.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

If the question concerns why a person is ill, B’atz means <em>at falta cho ri chac patan, at falta cho wa Mundo</em>, “you lack before the divining seeds, you lack before the Mundo”.

Forty days before marriage (<em>culanem*</em>), the groom, his "road guide" (<em>camal* be</em>), and his family all go to the house of the prospective bride, carrying sticks, called <em>botzoj*</em>, that are elaborately wound with flowers. This ritual, which involves hours of formal oratory called <em>tzonoj</em>, is most frequently performed on a low-numbered Batz, although Came, Akabal*, and Aj are also possible. The marriage itself will be performed on a day of the same name, but with the next higher number; thus a successful tzonoj falling on 1 Batz will be followed by a wedding forty days later, on 2 Batz. On 8 Batz, a novice diviner is publicly presented with his divining seeds, first at Chuti* Sabal and then at Paja*, at the particular hearths where the teacher and his wife received their own divining paraphernalia. This is parallel to the matrimonial "asking" in that the new diviner and their divining paraphernalia are thereafter considered to be husband and wife. Forty days later, on 9 Batz, the "marriage" of the diviner and the divining seeds is completed with a formal giving of thanks at Nima Sabal. (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

In a destiny divination, the meaning of E depends on the other days appearing with it. For example, if Imöx which indicates a confused, crazy, possessed condition immediately proceeds E in the results, it means "he has lost his road" (<em>xasachom ube</em>). On the other hand, a combination of E and Quej would indicate either that "we be guided on our road" (<em>cama* la kabe</em>) by the lineage priest-shaman, or that the client's destiny is to become a priest-shaman. However, if the person is ill and the question concerns who caused the illness, then the combination of Quej and E would indicate that a lineage priest-shaman placed a trap in the client's road.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“In an E year, each of the eighteen occurrences of the day E is celebrated with firecrackers, copal, and feasting at many locations in the municipality. The days 4 and 6 E are the eve (<em>mixprix</em>) of the ceremonies in the foundation shrine (<em>warabalja</em>) of both the canton and the patrilineage. The ceremony at the foundation shrine for people begins on 6 E, while that at the foundation for animals begins on 4 E. On these days, the patrilineage priest-shaman goes first to Paja *, the low, watery public shrine, and then to the low part of his own lineage's foundation shrine. The day 9 E is the final day or "big day" (<em>nima kij*</em>) for the initiation of a novice daykeeper, which takes place at Nima Sabal. On this day, the novice formally begins <em>ri utzilaj be, ri calominaj be, ri nimalaj be</em> ("the good road, the straight road, the long road") of their service to the people.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

On 7 Aj, in the ceremony for the people, the lineage priest-shaman first visits Chuti * Sabal, where he leaves paraffin candles for all known deceased priest-shamans of his patrilineage; then he goes and leaves vigil lights in the church for these same dead. On 8 and 9 Aj (and 8 and 9 Ajmac) the confraternities do the "washing of clothes" (<em>chajbal* atziak*</em>) for the saints in the parish church and cemetery chapel. On 11 Aj, the town priest-shaman from Los Cipréses visits Tamancu, the sacred mountain of the south, and then returns to offer paraffin candles on Paclom (in the center) to all dead lineage, canton, and town priest-shamans.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

A middle or high-numbered I’x, however, indicates that the trouble was sent by the Mundo, that the Mundo is the enemy. In this case, the only way to withdraw the illness is to change one’s relationship with the Mundo. Since I’x is a secretary to the Mundo, the best way to do this is to pay a fine to the secretary, who will give the money – in the form of copal, candles, sugar, and flowers, to the Mundo.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

There, they pray and offer copal to the Mundo, since I’x is the day specifically dedicated to the Mundo… [On 6 and 7 I’x…] the lineage priest-shaman […] asks the Mundo for money to buy the land and materials necessary to build a house. If a house is currently being built somewhere within his patrilineage, he then goes to the site to perform the house “planting” rituals, which protect the house from being hit by lightning, dissolved in a rainstorm, collapsed by an earthquake, or washed away in a flood.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

Tziquin, like Cat, is a secretary-treasurer for the Mundo, but Tziquin consecutively serves as secretary to the two most powerful and violent Mam, namely Quej and Ik, who are just as likely to destroy material well-being as to create it.

For example, in a divination about an illness, Kan and No’j would indicate that one should think about which <em>ajnawal mesa</em> caused this illness. Aj and No’j or Ajmaq and No’j would direct thought to family members, which K’at and No’j would direct thought to one’s debts to another person or to the Mundo.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

The higher the number, the more serious the dispute, ending (at 13) with the jailing of one or both parties and a public scandal. In divining for a marriage, journey, or business, Tijax would indicate that a fight would result. In an illness divination, Tijax would indicate slander, whether by an enemy or by the patient himself, as the cause.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“1 and 8 Tijax are two of the twenty-one permission days for the novice daykeeper. At this time, the student is reminded of the slanderous "trampling lips" (<em>xakabal chiaj</em>) of their friends, who might call them a fool or a witch for undergoing the training. They will do this either because they are jealous that the Mundo has not chosen them, or else because the Protestant missionaries or the Catholic priest have filled them with lies about "pagans" each Sunday morning. On 1, 6, 8, and 9 Tijax, daykeepers visiting the community shrines may ask that religious slanderers fight (<em>choj *</em>) among themselves rather than with them. On the same visit, they also ask that there be no jealousy or concealment (<em>kabanic*</em>) over financial or sexual matters among members of their own patrilineage.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“Junajpu days, like Aj days, are selected for house-building rituals; the priest-shaman specifically asks if the ancestors know (<em>quetaman ri Nantat</em>) and if they are in agreement concerning the new house. Junajpu days are also selected for the prayers and offerings that enable the spirit (<em>nawal</em>) of a dead person to enter the cold, dark room of the Mundo and thus join the other spirits. The younger and less powerful the person, the lower the number chosen. For example, the spirit of a baby enters the room on 1 Junajpu, a young married woman or man enter respectively on 5 and 6 Junajpu, while an old woman enters on 8 Junajpu and an old man on 9 Junajpu. A woman who has served as a midwife and/or daykeeper enters on 9 Junajpu, while a male priest-shaman enters from 9 to 12 Junajpu, depending on how high up in the priestly hierarchy he went. A person who has been town priest-shaman or second city manager enters on 12 Junajpu, and the powerful and capricious <em>ajnawal mesa</em> enters on 13 Junajpu.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“1 and 8 Junajpu are permission days for a novice daykeeper. On 1, 6, 8, and 9 Junajpu, individual daykeepers make offerings at the communal shrines before the ancestors (<em>chiquiwäch ri Nantat</em>). On 11 Junajpu, the town priest-shaman from Los Cipréses visits Socop, the sacred western mountain of the ancestors. Here he asks the ancestors for blessings (rather than the illnesses they can also send) for all living Momostecans.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

        <h2>The Mayan Cross</h2>
        <p>According to Molesky-Poz (2005), three signs interpret a person’s life: the birthdate and the dates nine days before and after, which represent their past and future. Molesky-Poz’s consultant reports, “This constellation tells us how to understand this person, the way he expresses himself, his characteristics. [...] Through this consultation, we are giving the person a schema for his life. There is an order for his life. [...] Following this blueprint, making offerings, paying on the first days will make this person happy. We are sure this is a direct form, one direct form within the cosmos to live in harmony, and to remember, to give back to the cosmos. You see in each of our day constellations, there is the Plumed Serpent.”</p>
	    <p>“The three days: one’s birth date, the day of the past, and the day of the future, influence one the most. The other six days are helpers. [...] It is within this map you find your vocation, your partner, your social organization. You see, embedded in the calendar is the Plumed Serpent. The calendar is one of its manifestations.”</p>
	    <p>Another consultant says. “We have to accept ourselves as we are. When I look at the calendar, then I can understand myself as I am and others as they are. I cannot criticize another person because every person carries abilities and weaknesses. In our communities we accept others in a very natural way. Parents know this child will be a businessperson or this girl will be a good healer. Only parents know it but we don’t talk about it. It is just part of life. In this way we respect it because we know each one has a work on earth. So we have to serve and respect elders because they have to complete their work. This is mutual respect and support." </p>
	    <p>“Every person is a specialist in what they need to do. As you know  your day and your capacities, you live out of that potential. You perfect yourself and your service to humanity. Then when we leave this life, we will have left this life satisfied that we have completed our work.”</p>
        <p>Once you have your Chol Q’ij date, check out the descriptions of each day below, making sure to incorporate the personality-modifying numbers. You can then calculate your Maya Cross - the larger context of the birthdate, the past, and future, as well as the “hemispheres” on the left and right and the four “helpers” on the corners. These create a grid of nine, by calculating forward and backward seven days from each of those three.</p>
        <p>Investigating the personality of each of these dates may help a person discover more about themselves and their lot in life. You can use this <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=dDM5bHI0MGRmaHY4M2E3ZmNuN3FhNXE2dTBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ">Google Calendar</a> to find the date (search the date like “8 Imox” - dates will populate starting in about 2018). You can also use the Google Calendar to find when the next iteration of your Chol Q’ij “birthday” occurs so you can celebrate it if you desire. </p>
