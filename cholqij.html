      <h1 id="title">What is the Chol Q'ij?</h1>
        <p>The Chol Q’ij is the sacred 260 day calendar of the Maya people in the Highlands of Guatemala. Chol Q’ij is K’iche for “count of days”; it is also called the Tzolk’in in Yucateco. It can also be referred to as the “Highland Sacred Round”.</p>
        <p>The Chol Q’ij is often envisioned as two gears moving together, one of twenty “named” days and one of thirteen accompanying numbers. The first day of the cycle is 8 B’atz (celebrated as a secondary “New Year”), the second is 9 E’, the third is 10 Aj, and so on, so that each of the 260 days has its own unique combination of a number and day name.</p>
        <div class="cq_rotating_gears imagecontainer">
            <img src="images/chol qij.png" alt="Two gears labeled with the thirteen numbers and twenty day names. The arrows on each indicate they are rotating together."/>
            <figcaption>The Chol Q'ij numbers and day names, envisioned as gears.</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p> The 20 day names are <strong style="color: hsl(248.3, 92%, 24.5%)">Imox, Iq', Aq'ab'al, K'at, Kan, Kame, Kej, Q'anil, Toj, Tz'i', B'atz', E', Aj, I'x, Tz'ikin, Ajmaq, No'j, Tijax, Kawoq, and Ajpu.</strong></p>
        <p>In the Chol Q’ij, each of the twenty named days has a personality or character that is tempered or strengthened by the number of the day. According to Tedlock’s (1992) informants, low numbers (1-3) are gentle and indicate something young or new, and the high numbers (11-13) are powerful or violent, indicating more serious or “older” matters, but each number has layers of unique meaning beyond this. </p>
        <p>Initiated priests in this three-thousand-year-old tradition, called <em>ajq’ija’</em> or “day-keepers” (singular <em>aj q’ij</em>), interpret each date of the Chol Q’ij calendar and determine which rituals or prayers to perform; the community members that continue to follow the old ways request dream interpretations, divinations regarding their futures, interpretations of the will of the spirits and ancestors, and advice on good days to hold weddings, plant crops, or start a new business (Molesky-Poz, 2006; Tedlock, 1992). </p>
        <p>12 No’j, for example, is the best day to propose or defend a project. As the last even number before a beginning a new cycle, 12 represents a summing up of one’s actions and experience, and No’j is the best day to join ideas, give advice, or cultivate science (Anonymous, <em>aj q’ij</em>, Kaqchikel Maya of Patzún, Chimaltenango, Guatemala, personal communication, April 2016).</p>
        <p>The Chol Q’ij also holds astrological value on an individual level. Much like the Western concept of astrology, children are said to develop certain personalities and characteristics depending on the day that they were born. However, unlike Western astrology, this is not based on the location of the planets in certain quadrants of the sky at the moment of birth, but rather the confluence of the energies and rhythms of Mayan time that converge at the moment of conception and manifest at the moment of birth. </p>
        <p>For instance, children born on the day 9 No’j would be innovative thinkers, patient, curious, self-sufficient, and idealistic about justice, but stubborn and independent to a fault (Tedlock, 1992; Barrios, 2015). Most people in the highlands of Guatemala know their Chol Q’ij birthday and that of their children; many children are given traditional Maya names based on their birthday. These energies are concieved of as a guide or <em>ruwäch q'ij</em> ("the heart of the day") that for those who permit themselves to know it can give meaning to life and become a profound influence. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Ruwäch Q'ij</h2>
            <p>Mesoamerican traditionalists believe that the personality traits indicated by one’s birth date on the Chol Q’ij are embodied in a kindred animal spirit that accompanies, protects, and guides a person through life (García et al., 2009; Gonzalez, 2011; Shea, 2001). According to Gonzalez (2011), those who subscribe to this idea generally believe that the human and their animal counterpart share a soul, though cultural groups disagree on whether the animal is a physical entity, a metaphor, or a literal spirit that accompanies the person through their life. This animal, called the <em>ruwäch q’ij</em> (the heart of the day) in Kaqchikel or the nahual in Nahuatl, embodies their personality, their occupation, and their destiny. 
            <p>"The nahual or <em>ruwäch q’ij</em> ("the heart or fruit of the day") can be understood as a gift, mission, vocation, or innate quality that you bring with you at your birth to help you. That is today, accepting the mission enters a person into correspondence and compatibility with the universe. The service of the gift given to you by nature blesses you with much satisfaction in your life, permits you to achieve the function that you possess, and understand that each person is a small but complementary part of the universe." (pg 225, Ruxe’el Mayab’ K’aslemal. Raiz espiritu del conocimiento maya, translation mine). </p>
            <p>To know the identity of <em>ruwäch aq’ij</em> (the heart of <em>your</em> day) is taken as tacit acceptance of the mission set by it, and to accept the mission is to begin to walk the path that the gods and ancestors have laid out for you and to be blessed with satisfaction in your life. (García et al., 2009). The Kaqchikel believe that all the world has a <em>ruwäch q’ij</em> but only certain people are privileged to identify its species. </p>
            <p>Each of the 20 day names on the Chol Q'ij corresponds to at least one unique animal; some days have a variety, to allow for personality and personal choice. The nature of one’s <em>ruwäch q’ij</em> and thus one’s soul is to be kept secret; however, traditional Mayan names give away the nature of the <em>ruwäch q’ij</em> (such as Wuqu’ I’x having a jaguar, or Ixkame an owl) to those who are “in the know'' such as elders and daykeepers. In some areas, it is believed that those that know the form of <em>ruwäch kiq’ij</em> (the face of their day) may be able to take its form and shapeshift, flying like a bird, leaping over barriers, or performing tasks that would not be possible in human form (Shea, 2001).</p>
            <p>Whether the animal is literal or spirit, it is thought possible to physically interact with it and even to harm it if you know its name. Those who believe this version know that when something bad happens to the <em>ruwäch q’ij</em>, there is a corresponding repercussion for their human. As such, elders and community members keep the identity of the <em>ruwäch q’ij</em> a secret from a child until they are older. This also serves the benefit of keeping children from imitating their animal spirits artificially so that they instead will develop traits and characteristics naturally. Accordingly, “an individual may be aggressive or passive, nervous or calm, outgoing or shy, flamboyant or retiring, mischievous or serious, graceful or clumsy, all depending on the nature of the animal spirit (Shea, 2001; pg 55)”.</p>

                    <h3>1 Jun</h3>
                    <p>The number 1 in the Chol Q'ij often signifies <strong>beginnings, unity, and potent focus</strong>. It is the spark of creation, the initial impulse from which all else unfolds.</p>
                    <p>Consider it a day for initiating new projects, clarifying intentions, and standing independently in your purpose.</p>
                    <h4>Key Themes for Jun:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unity</li>
                        <li>Initiation</li>
                        <li>Potential</li>
                        <li>Originality</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Position</h4>
                    <p>Jun is a low and odd number, which usually represents something challenging. However, the seed can grow into a mighty tree, it is full of potential. It needs the correct nutrients and conditions to germinate and develop its potential. We also may need encouragement to develop our ideas.</p>
                    <p>Daykeepers usually do rituals on a 1 day, and in some traditional communities there is a special shrine dedicated to the number 1.</p>
                    <h4>Effect</h4>
                    <p>Trustful and independent. Do not expect a jun person to be bothered with the details or to bring the final touch to things. The Jun is more efficient when confronted with a challenge.</p>
                `,

                    <h3>2 Ka'i'</h3>
                    <p>Ka'i' brings themes of <strong>duality, partnership, and important choices</strong>. It highlights relationships, cooperation, and the balance of opposing forces.</p>
                    <p>This day may ask you to consider different perspectives or to work collaboratively. Decisions made on a '2' day can have significant relational impacts.</p>
                    <h4>Key Themes for Ka'i'</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Duality</li>
                        <li>Partnership</li>

                        <li>Cooperation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Position</h4>
                    <p>Although a low number, it has surprising strength. It is said to be able to call upon both aspects or polarities of what it is attached to. It is said to be the number of lovers, it signifies relationships and self-sacrifice.</p>
                    <h4>Effect</h4>
                    <p>The energy of ka’i’ is to always consider the positive from the negative and to progress in a well balanced way through the different choices to be made, light/darkness, male/female, right/wrong, Yin/Yang. The energy of ka’i’ finds its reason to be by experimenting with differences. Whilst it can lend itself to mediation, seeing both sides of the story, it also can be indecisive.</p>

                    <h3>3: Oxi'</h3>
                    <p>Oxi' relates to <strong>rhythm, action, and the sacred hearth or home</strong>. It signifies creative expression, movement, and the coming together of energies.</p>
                    <p>Oxi’ represents the 3 hearthstones of the Maya home, on the fire supporting the tortilla griddle. From an astronomical point of view, the stones are the stars Alnitak, Saiph and Rigel in the constellation we call Orion, and the Smoky Fireplace is the Great Orion Nebula (M42). The Number 3 relates to the three worlds of the Mayan cosmovision – Heaven, Earth, and the Underworld.</p>
                    <p>It's a dynamic number that can bring activity and the need for clear communication within family or groups.</p>
                    <h4>Key Themes for Oxi'</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Action and rhythm</li>
                        <li>Home</li>
                        <li>Germination</li>

                        <li>Communication</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Position</h4>
                    <p>The number 3 is still in the low end of the range of numbers. It does not have much energy yet, and it is also an odd number.</p>
                    <h4>Effect</h4>
                    <p>it lacks stability and can represent challenges and obstructions. The number three brings up internal/external dilemmas. The lack of stability in the physical, external world that it brings suggests that the more appropriate action is to look to the internal world, both of the home and yourself.</p> 
                    <p>The energy of oxi’ is very eloquent through all forms of personal expression. The communication purpose is to establish a consensus between any point A and any point B. Since the basic movement is vibration, the oxi’ person is in the very core of the rhythm; often agitated, movement being their very nature. By working closely to the energy of the 3, anyone can foretell whatever movement. But 3 can be a difficult number nevertheless. Carl Jung, objecting to the notion of a Trinity, said that the number 3 is incomplete. The Maya would agree. This is a difficult number, and implies doubt, risk, uncertainty. Many traditional Daykeepers avoid initiating new projects on a 3 day.</p>

                    <h3>4: Kaji'</h3>
                    <p>Kaji' represents <strong>stability, foundation, and the four cardinal directions or pillars</strong>. It is a number of order, structure, and practical manifestation.</p>
                    <p>Four represents the cardinal points, the four colours of maize, the four carriers of the year, the two equinoxes and two solstices, as well as midnight, sunrise, midday and sunset. These four components of each day, each “sun,” can be conceptually expanded to include the solstices and equinoxes; thus the year is also a 4. There is evidence that the Classic Maya divided the universe into four sections marked by the two intersections of the Milky Way with the ecliptic. Thus we live in a fourfold universe. The Maya still lay out their ritual altars in a fourfold pattern. The number four is representative of the four first men. It was said to be they who raised the sky from the sea to create the world we live in. In Mayan myth it is four pillars that support the sky from the Earth. As you can imagine, kaji’ is a number which represents stability, a good, down-to-Earth number.</p>
                    <p>A day for building, organizing, and attending to the material aspects of life.</p>

                    <p>Wo'o is often associated with <strong>empowerment, the center, and the human hand (work and action)</strong>. It's a pivotal number that can represent the core of a matter or the application of will.</p>
                    <p>Wo’o’ is the four cardinal directions plus the center point. The Sacred Mayan calendar is said to be a calendar of human life. It can be seen as a microcosm of the human body. The number five is one of these parts. It is representative of the hand with its five digits. It is with our hands that we work, and with what we earn we pay our debts, so this is the number of work, the actions that we perform in life. Wo’o’ is also a number that relates to the sacred fire where we pay our debts with offerings and prayers.</p>
                    <p>This day can be for taking charge, focusing energy, and accomplishing tasks.</p>

Wo’o’ is an intelligent force that organizes communications, materials, knowledge and their application. By nature the wo’o’ people deal with networks and gather what they need. These persons go straight to the crux of any situation which makes excellent investigators out of them.</p>

                                <p>The day sign Imox carries profound significance related to the origins of life and the inherent energies of the universe. According to Molesky-Poz (2006), Imox symbolizes the material beginning of existence, encompassing both earthly life and the individual's internal journey. It's associated with "craziness," not as mental illness, but as a state of possession or an excessive focus on minute details. Furthermore, Imox is linked to the occult forces of the universe and necessitates humility before Mam, the Earth Lord. In essence, this interpretation emphasizes Imox as a primordial force tied to the physical inception of life and the enigmatic powers that govern the cosmos.</p>
                                <p>Stanzione (2006) presents Imox as the "First Mother," a vital feminine principle deeply intertwined with water and regeneration. Imox resides where the sky and earth merge with the ocean, particularly in the saline environments of mangroves and estuaries filled with water lilies. Symbolized by both the water lily and a canoe-tipping caiman, Imox embodies the Spirit of Rain and Water. This entity's "massive dismembered body" is the source of diverse life forms on Earth, thriving in "fertile" and "fecund" places abundant with various creatures. Imox represents the "wetness" from which life originates, the female sex, and the feminine principle, making it the first day of both the Long Count Cycle and the twenty-day divinatory calendar round—a source of life, mother energy, primal waters, blood, nurturance, and abundance. This perspective elevates Imox to a foundational and generative force, essential for both physical life and the emergence of Mesoamerican civilization.</p>
                                <p>Barrios (2015) interprets Imox as a day favorable for enhancing mental receptivity and spiritual strength. It drives the energies of change, allowing individuals to plan their life's steps and capture nature's messages. Imox is connected to intuition, perception, dream revelations, and the "Left Hand Path," aiding in the development of dormant feelings and signifying the essence of unspoken emotions. Imox embodies the subtle aspects of humanity, including sensitivity, the unusual, and the eccentric, distinguishing it from established norms. It represents a form of "craziness" that is not mental illness but rather something strange and bizarre. This view highlights Imox as an energy of personal growth, transformation, and the exploration of unconventional or hidden aspects of being.</p>

                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Imox are naturally intuitive and often provide insightful advice. They possess sharp mental agility, readily perceive and interpret subtle messages from their environment, and exhibit strong creative and productive tendencies. Furthermore, they have a genuine desire to assist others. Those born under Imox frequently experience good fortune, which they are inclined to share. They hold a deep concern for the well-being of their community and are capable of pursuing ambitious endeavors that others might find daunting. Due to their inherent spiritual understanding, they often serve as guides for others on a spiritual path.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>People born under Imox can be prone to indecisiveness, insecurity, and doubt, occasionally manifesting as violent or dishonest behavior. They may encounter challenges in romantic relationships, potentially becoming overly dependent, jealous, or possessive. There might be a tendency toward addictive behaviors, lying, seeking out confrontation, or being selfish and abrupt. Without achieving inner balance, they risk developing a cruel or sarcastic demeanor.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“In divination for an illness, Imox indicates that an enemy has asked for the illness; the lower the number, the less serious the illness. As an early result in a marriage divination, Imox means the desired [partner] would cause the client to become crazy; through their unfaithfulness or other malicious actions, they would dominate the client. In divining for a journal or a business deal, Imox indicates so many problems and so much complexity that one would become crazy.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“On 1, 6, and 8 Imox, a daykeeper visits the appropriate public shrines where they humble themselves before the Mam (Kej, E’m No’j, and Iq’) so as not to be dominated by their power, which makes one go crazy.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>The energy of Iq' embodies air, wind, and the secret breath of life, carrying mystic spirituality and intelligence; it is the day of the winds of the altars that fill us with life. Stanzione (2006) describes Iq' as associated with the North and the color white, one of the four Year Bearers. It is the north wind, a drying, pollen-blowing, ripening, and harvesting wind, also known as the "Lord of Dust". This spirit or vital energy moves the world towards change, with inspiration and creativity as its essence and the breath of life as its manifestation. Wind is the spirited "mover" of life on Earth, and it was the wind embodied in Lord Q'uq'umatz (Quetzalcoatl) that set the world in motion, bringing maize as a civilizing gift to Mesoamerican people. Wind is also a road-sweeper, clearing paths to destiny, an inseminator and destroyer of crops, a bringer of harmonious breeze and human disease, representing our ever-transforming destiny. </p>
                                <p>Iq' is a day of altars, nature, air, spirit, and earth, good for asking for illnesses and negativity to be taken away, for spiritual growth, and path clearing. Barrios (2015) adds that the day Iq' is for giving thanks for renewal and good winds that fuel minds and purify, propitious for treating psychological problems, controlling passions, hatreds, and depressions.  This day reinforces prayers to the Great Father and is for developing mental power, intuition, and directing thought.</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Those born under Iq' are described as pure of action and adaptable to any situation. They can be excellent executives with the courage to confront crises, as well as dreamers and merchants with physical and mental strength who capture divine visions. They possess innovative ideas and futuristic vision and can be excellent advice-givers for mental problems. Mayan-Calendar.com notes they love nature, the outdoors, and fresh air; they are mystical, spiritual people who inspire others, possessing vitality, imagination, physical strength, and a love of traveling, and can be brave and sometimes wild. Stanzione (2006) characterizes them as nature people who love fresh air and the spirit of place, mystical, airy, and spiritual personalities with vitality to inspire, potentially becoming aj q'ij (daykeepers and diviners). They are full of life, imagination, physical strength, and are dreamers who, when grounded, become very successful. Barrios (2015) states that Iq' individuals are very spiritual, possess cosmic energy, and can be spiritual medics. They have great mental agility, capacity for comprehension, good memory, are great mathematicians, adaptable, great manipulators with power over words, and a strong power to convince. Tedlock (1982) mentions a child born on Ik' will be a bravo, strong, wild, even violent person who could be trained as an ajnawal mesa, often assuming high office due to personal power.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>On the unfavorable side, Iq' individuals can be dreamers who drift, dishonest tricksters, negligent, violent, imposing, and may do whatever they please at others' expense, sometimes needing help to stay focused. Their personal power can inspire fear and hatred in others. Barrios (2015) notes they are impulsive and may get sick frequently if they do not make offerings to the gods, and cannot develop their spiritual strength if they do not follow a good path. As tempestuous and changing people, they can be very tender but quickly become angry without visible reason. They can be obsessive and capricious, and their imagination can be an obstacle, making it hard to distinguish reality from illusion. They can be of very strong character, temperamental and extremist thinkers, inconstant, impulsive, and bilious, with a tendency toward infidelity. They can also be impure, choleric, violent, dishonest, suffer social and economic problems, be proud, vengeful, stubborn, tend to depression, and believe they are always right. Stanzione (2006) adds they can be like the wind, here today and gone tomorrow, and can be violent, tumultuous, or imposing, saying whatever comes to mind.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“In divination for an illness, Ik indicates that the client has an enemy against him (<em>contra  culel</em>) who induced a rage (<em>eyawarinak</em>) or frenzy (<em>chuj</em>) within him. The result was illness. The lower the number, the more recent the rage and the less serious the resulting illness. In a marriage divination, Ik is a negative answer, indicating that the woman named is an enemy (<em>culel</em>), since she is too passionate and emotional (<em>lawalo</em>) and will bring frenzy (<em>chuj</em>) and destruction to the home and family. Ik is such a bad day for a journey or business deal that most Momostecan merchants will avoid transactions altogether on high-numbered Ik days.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“Ik is such a dangerous Mam that the usual ceremonies for the current Mam are performed only on 1, 6, and 8 Ik during an Ik year. On these days, priest-shamans ask that they, their families, and clients not be crushed by the violence of Ik. They specifically ask that lightning, earthquake, flood, or landslide not destroy their homes, themselves, or their domestic animals. They also ask that the strong negative human emotions of hatred, anger, rage (<em>eyawarinak</em>), and frenzy (<em>chuj</em>) not fall upon themselves, their family, or their clients. A powerful and evil daykeeper or ajnawal mesa uses a high-numbered Ik to induce these negative, destructive rages, in nature as well as in humans. On such days, people may be dominated to some degree by violent passions, no matter how hard they try not to be.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                                <p>Aq'ab'al represents the dawn, the first rays of sunlight that shatter the night's obscurity and confusion, symbolizing peace, happiness, and the guardian of all creation. Stanzione (2006) associates this energy with the West and the color black, the place of "Darkness" and "Divination" where sacred fire is kindled at dawn. It is linked to the Obsidian Mirror of prophecy and the knowledge gained from the transformations of the starry night. Aq'ab'al is the "house of darkness" or "house of trials," representing the end of the old and the beginning of the new, like embers and newborn fire, the dark place beside the sacred hearthstones where warmth and light return. Barrios (2015) states this day is propitious for clearing paths, creating new opportunities, renewing life, gaining clarity, bringing hidden things to light, and resolving mysteries. It is also a time for constructing stability, finding good work or business, and giving thanks for life-giving things, relationships, and emotions.</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Individuals born on Aq'ab'al are generally serene but strong, usually succeeding in their goals. They are positive people, problem solvers, and generous with their advice, seeking truth and justice. They are often travelers who take to the road in both happiness and sorrow and are described as feminine, verbally skillful, and wealthy. Tedlock (1982) notes that a child born on Akab'al will be feminine, wealthy, verbally skillful, and may possess an extra body-soul called "lightning" (coyopa), enabling direct communication with natural and supernatural worlds, potentially leading them to become a lineage priest-shaman or a "road guide"/marriage spokesman. Stanzione (2006) characterizes them as people of the Dawn, early morning risers, who are serene but strong, bringing projects to fruition. They are generous and intelligent advisers who find solutions for themselves and others. They make good doctors, physiotherapists, writers, artists, warriors, and mathematicians.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>A potential challenge for those born on Aq'ab'al is that they often live in the past or the future, thereby missing the present; like the dawn, they exist between day and night. Mayan-Calendar.com also notes they can be thieves, vengeful, angry, dishonest, prone to illness, and may wish for the end of their enemies. Stanzione (2006) concurs that at their worst they can be thieves, problem makers, angry, and dishonest, with a propensity to desire the end of their enemies. Tedlock (1982) also mentions they could possibly be a liar, cheat, or complainer.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“When the day Akabal appears in a divination, the diviner must select from the three mnemonics and their ritual associations a coherent but inspired answer to the client's question. For example, if 1, 8, or 9 Akabal should appear in divining why a person is ill, the diviner will explore with the client (if the client is a member of his own patrilineage) the possibility that a family member fought with him or spoke ill of him behind his back on one of the days of the lineage rituals. If, however, the diviner is from another patrilineage, he will explore whether or not the priest-shaman of the client's own patrilineage who might even be the client's own father, brother, or uncle had reason to complain about him before the Mundo. Was the client not giving money to this priest shaman? Or did he drunkenly abuse the priest-shaman or his wife, sister, or daughter?, and so forth.</p>
                                <p>If the question concerns whether or not a specific woman will marry the client, and an Akabal of any number 1 through 9 appears first, then the answer is yes. If the assembled priest-shamans of a patrilineage, a canton, or the entire town are divining whether a particular person should fill a vacancy in their ranks and if a great majority, if not all of them, arrive at Akabal on the first round, then the answer is yes. If the question concerns whether a particular journey should be undertaken and the first answer is either a low or middle-numbered Akabal *, then the answer is yes, the road is open. But if the result is 10, 11, 12, or 13 Akabal, the answer is no: there is something hidden in the road. The high number calls attention to the negative aspect of Akabal.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“On 1, 8, and 9 Akabal *, the teacher of a new priest-shaman performs an opening ritual (<em>cabal*</em>) for the shrines of his student's patrilineage; he cleans out all the ashes accumulated by the student's predecessor. During the days on which lineage rituals were performed at these shrines, any ill feelings voiced within the patrilineage entered the shrine, which as a "little volcano" connected with all other volcanoes and mountains, placed these words directly before the Mundo. This is the source of the mnemonic <em>chakabaj*</em> ("tricks, lies, slander, and blame"); the removal of the ashes starts the initiate out with a clean slate or rather, a clean hearth. Also on Akabal, a young man and his family plan his marriage, first approaching the Mundo through the agency of his lineage priest-shaman, who will open (<em>cabal</em>) the lineage shrines on 1 Akabal, and then on 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 Akabal approaching the girl's family. This approach is usually made in early dawn, hence the mnemonic <em>akabil*</em> ("at dawn"). An Akabal day is also chosen to introduce (through prayer) a new baby to the ancestors at the lineage shrine.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <p>This day calls for careful examination of problems, untangling knots in one's life, and making offerings to clear karmic debts or ask for abundance (as a net gathers).</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>K'at signifies the carrying net, harvest net, or a womb, and is also associated with heat, fire, and fervor. Molesky-Poz (2006) describes it as a sensitive day that can "roast" one and symbolizes fire. It's a special day for entangling or snaring, but also for untangling and unsnaring; it is a day to seek companionship and form groups. Stanzione (2006) elaborates that K'at relates to the burning of the earth before planting maize, representing the charred palace of death that becomes a green field of life and sustenance. It embodies the sacrifice and work required for harvest and the burning heat that brings fruition. K'at is a day to remember the necessity of feeding the Heart of the Earth and Sky so humanity can be sustained. It's also a day for binding others, performing witchcraft, catching thieves, asking for children and crops, and repaying life with sacred fire and offerings. Barrios (2015) states this day is propitious for overcoming obsessions, undoing tangles and problems, building abundance, ensuring female fertility, withdrawing malign energies, and repairing emotional or love-related problems.</p>

                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Individuals born under K'at are often collectors of things, thoughts, and ideas. They are community problem solvers and negotiators, youthful and passionate people who are wise and fecund, benefiting most they come in contact with, and are opposed to fighting. Stanzione (2006) describes them as loving to collect all that comes their way, including thoughts and ideas. They are able to bring different viewpoints into a single bundle and return it as a solution. These are passionate people with "fire" in their hearts and hands, who are wise, artistic, gardeners, merchants, collectors, and distributors. When they become Aj Q'ij, they accumulate many stones and relics, and are able to transform the profane into the sacred through their "fire" and "ordered words".</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>On the unfavorable side, people born on K'at can be fornicators and debtors. They may also be nervous and a bad influence on others. Tedlock (1982) states that a person whose birthday is K'at will be a fornicator or debtor or both, and is considered unfit for any sort of civil, political, military, or religious office.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“When the day Cat appears in divination, the diviner has a pretty good idea that, regardless of the question, the client is somehow lacking in his duties to the Mundo or ancestors, or else in the everyday social world. The number that proceeds Cat then indicates how recent this debt is and (consequently) how serious.</p>
                                <p>For example, 3 Cat * indicates a fairly recent and inconsequential debt, while 10 Cat indicates <em>nimalaj casaj*</em> (a large, old, serious debt or quantity of debts). As the diviner says, the client "is carrying a heavy net bag or suitcase." In order to cancel these debts, the client must give the priest-shaman nets full or heaps (<em>pa cat*, pa chim</em>) of copal, which will then be offered in their name to the Mundo and the ancestors.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“During the two consecutive years when Cat is Secretary for example, in 1975 and 1976 great stacks of offerings are given on 1, 6, 8, and 9 Cat in order to make up for any neglect of duties to the Mundo or the ancestors. At this time, people also take care of monetary, work, or other debts, both within the immediate family and at the local stores. The verb <em>catic</em> besides meaning "to burn," carries the metaphorical meaning that a married person is committing adultery with a virgin of either sex, expressed in full by the idiom <em>catic rakan</em>, "to burn their leg." This sort of sexual misconduct is a serious offense before the Mundo, who places the person "in debt" (<em>casaj</em>); if the debt is not cancelled, it will bring illness and even death to the offender.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>Kan represents the serpent, symbolizing the force of the universe, the warmth of the Plumed Serpent (Q'ukumatz), which communicates between earth and sky as a manifestation of the Heart of the Sky and Heart of the Earth; it is the mystery of coiling in creation and the sign of the Creator, embodying the duality of good and bad, and the day of justice. Stanzione (2006) elaborates that Kan is the serpent of wisdom, knowledge, authority, justice, truth, and equilibrium. This ancient one gave vision to seers through venom and is also a healer and sacred medicine. The energy of Kan helps balance anger, bringing peace and harmony, much like a striking snake is followed by calming rains. Twitching in the body, known as "kumatz" or "snake," is likened to "lightning in the blood" by contemporary curers. The coiled headdress (tocoyal) worn by highland women symbolizes a coiled snake and is linked to the moon goddess, a source and curer of disease. Kan embodies "serpent knowledge" used by calendar priests for divination and appeasing deities. </p>
                                <p>It is a good day to ask for wisdom, protection, and to remember the feminine principle, intuition, and knowledge, seeking equilibrium and peace. Barrios (2015) adds it is a particular day for increasing physical strength, developing inner fire, spiritual evolution, the return of the lost or forgotten, reconciliation, asking things from a partner, sexual balance, and making intentions real, as well as giving thanks for knowledge and wisdom.</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Those born under Kan are often wise and energetic people. They are born healers and fair judges, very quiet but aware of everything around them, only offering opinions when asked. They are sincere, intelligent, with a good mind for scientific investigation, and intuitive to the point of being clairvoyant. As lovers of peace and justice, they are often in positions of power and look for the good in their communities. Stanzione (2006) describes them as wise, energetic, and earth-bound like the snake, sincere, intelligent, and intuitive, strong yet delicate people who make great state officials, lawyers, arbitrators, healers, doctors, nurses, and midwives.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Potential negative traits for Kan individuals include being angry and easily annoyed. They can also be disloyal, resentful, gossipers, and opportunistic. Tedlock (1982) states that a person whose birthday is Kan will be a strong, powerful, evil person, with the character becoming more extreme with higher numbers; possessing "body lightning," they should tame their power by becoming an ajnawal mesa. Stanzione (2006) concurs they can be angry, disloyal, and opportunistic when forced into their negative side.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“When Can appears in a divination, the diviner immediately asks the client who his enemy (<em>ri culel</em>) could be. He may then explore the possibility that an ajmesa might have been hired by this enemy to send illness or death. If the client is already ill, the diviner will help the client to determine which ajmesa was hired to work against him; then he will help him choose a different, but equally powerful, ajmesa to defend him before the Mundo. If the divination concerns marriage, a business deal, or the selection of a religious leader, the day Can means that the woman, business associate, or priest-shaman in question is an enemy (<em>ri culel *</em>) or may become one, and all plans should be dropped immediately.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“Can is associated with the actions of a calendar diviner who has been trained as an ajmesa, or ajnawal mesa. These practitioners are simultaneously the most successful curers and a source of serious illness and death. Because of their power, some patrilineages in Momostenango have even selected an ajmesa as their patrilineage priest-shaman. On Can days with high numbers 11, 12, 13 these powerful diviners visit the sacred mountains of Momostenango and even distant volcanoes, speaking directly to the Mundo in order to cause or cure specific illnesses according to the desires of their patrilineage members or private clients. On low-numbered Can days for example, 1, 6, and 8 diviners who are not ajmesa petition the Mundo not to allow the latter to send illnesses to their lineage, their clients, or themselves. On 9 Can, ajmesa come from several Quiché municipalities to the foot of a high waterfall near San Cristóbal Totonicapán, known as "Nine Chairs Nine Tables" (<em>Belejeb Silla Belejeb Mesa</em>). There they first sweep (<em>caban mes</em>) the shrines ("chair" shrines are small individual shrines and "table" shrines are large public shrines) and then sacrifice chickens in order to cure illnesses sent to their clients by witches from the coast and from the municipality of Cobán.

                        <h4>Short Summary</h4>
                            <p>Kame signifies <strong>death, transformation, and connection with the ancestors</strong>. It represents the ultimate letting go, the end of cycles, and the gateway to rebirth.</p>
                            <p>This is not necessarily a negative day, but one for honoring those who have passed, releasing what no longer serves, and recognizing the profound peace and wisdom that comes from accepting mortality.</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>Kame signifies death, the termination of something, of life, or of obscurity; it is a symbol of day and night, encompassing many roads, nervousness, sickness, and is a day to ask for pardon. Stanzione (2006) describes Kame as the Lord or Lords of Death, with North as its direction and bone white its color, referencing One Death and Seven Death from the Popol Vuh as Lords of Xibalba, the Maya Underworld. Death is viewed as a place of completion and a precursor to rebirth, with the Maya celebrating the end of time periods with great ritual to begin anew. Death brings revelation, transformation, conclusion, and the "knowing" at the end of a spiritual quest; it's the flower manifesting life's effort. For the Maya, death was natural, like changing seasons, and the place of transformation. Adolescents underwent "the little death" with hallucinogens to find their spirit guide and life's calling. Facing death forces great changes, either strengthening or weakening individuals. Illnesses reveal the Land of the Dead to Maya shamans, showing them the path to becoming healers. Kame is a day to remember the dead and see oneself in the long process of human growth and transformation, a day of thanks and offerings for sacred life.</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>People born on Kame are often very patient. They are serene, content, generous, caring, and charismatic, seemingly always able to cope with problems with a good attitude. Their lives are balanced through wisdom, and they are respectful of others. They are strong, tenacious, and respected people of authority, talented at their work, and can be prophets of both good and bad; they are also described as wealthy, feminine, and verbally skillful. Tedlock (1982) notes that a child born on Kame, like one born on Akab'al, will be wealthy, somewhat feminine, and verbally skillful, and due to receiving "body lightning," might become a lineage priest-shaman or a marriage spokesman. Stanzione (2006) adds they are often called to be Aj Q'ij, day keepers, diviners, healers, and midwives; their intuition can lead to clairvoyance, making them wise counselors, doctors, psychologists, philosophers, and historians.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>On the unfavorable side, individuals born on Kame can be violent and vengeful. They may also be liars, unappreciative, and unfaithful in love and commerce. Stanzione (2006) concurs that when out of balance, they become violent and vengeful lords of death and can be liars and unfaithful in love and commerce,</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“When a divination concerns whether or not a particular woman will make a good wife for the client, a high-numbered Came means an emphatic yes, while a low number is less clearly affirmative. Since money, business, and travel are considered analogous to spouses, the question as to whether or not to take a particular trip or make a particular business deal is answered affirmatively when Came appears. At this moment, the diviner might say, <em>Camej lal mayij tokob*</em> ("There is a favor"). The amount of the favor depends upon the size of the number, with 13 Came representing a tremendous success or a great fortune. However, if the divination concerns the cause of an illness, 13 Came could mean that a very long dead (<em>camical</em>) member of the client's own patrilineage sent the illness, and that the client probably will not recover.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“On 1 and 8 Came, permission days for the divining seeds, a priest-shaman who has a student burns copal at the earth shrines. He requests tranquility among his students, himself, and all deceased diviners, as well as between himself and his own divining equipment, and between himself and all other members, both living and dead, of his own patrilineage. Low-numbered Came days are also used for marriage proposals, as well as for the indigenous marriage ceremony itself. Since marriage (<em>culanem</em>), which is an important alliance between the living members of different patrilineages, is also an alliance between dead (<em>camical</em>) family members of both patrilineages, these dead kin must be in accord or else they will send trouble, illness, and even death into the new home. On 11 Came, the town priest-shaman from Los Cipréses visits Pipil, the sacred mountain of the north, in order to ask for tranquility between women and men, indigenes and ladinos, the people of Guatemala and the government of Guatemala, and between the nation of Guatemala and all other nations of the world.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>Kej represents the deer and the pillars of the four cardinal points that sustain the dynamic relationship between earth and sky; it is a day of solid foundations, authority, and honesty. Stanzione (2006) associates Kej with the West and the color black, with the deer as prey embodying the hunger that drives predators. Like Venus, the deer is active at dawn and dusk. The Moon Goddess transformed into a deer to be impregnated so Quetzalcoatl could be born. The Deer-Jaguar Dance re-enacts the hunter-hunted dynamic, and deer, as predators of maize fields, were trapped by hunters in those same fields. As great runners and jumpers, deer symbolize avoiding obstacles, and Aj Q'ij use this day to divine ways to avoid traps or escape destruction. The world stands on the deer's four hooves, and its movements, like the wind (Iq'), cause the Sky-Earth to revolve. Maya codices were drawn on deer skin, signifying the movement of time, and sacrificed deer blood brought rains for maize, which fed both humans and deer. Kej is a good day for Aj Q'ij to return to nature for revitalization and to remember ancestors who protected maize fields by hunting deer; it is a day of strength, sustenance, and focus on the "hunt".</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Individuals born on Kej are strong people, both spiritually and physically. They are agile, responsible, friendly, and intelligent, able to convince others of their position and sure of themselves. Respected in their communities as an authority that comes from the ancestors, they are able to endure great hardship while enjoying fine health and are described as masculine. Tedlock (1982) notes a baby born on Kej will be physically, psychically, and verbally strong, domineering, and masculine, potentially becoming a leader in worldly and religious matters after shaman-priest initiation. Stanzione (2006) describes them as 'guides' and 'principales' of the pueblo, their authority stemming from ancestors; they make good administrators, public servants, merchants, psychologists, socio-cultural scientists, consultants, and spiritual guides.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Potential negative traits for Kej individuals include being angry, bothersome, addictive, opportunistic, foolish, and demanding, causing trouble and sorrow for others. Tedlock (1982) warns that if they choose a negative path, they could become an evil witch, mounting others and causing trouble and sorrow. Stanzione (2006) adds they can override the opinion of others and at their worst can be angry, bothersome, addictive, opportunists, and demanding.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“In divination, the day Quej points to a calendar diviner of some type. For example, if a group of priest-shamans of a patrilineage, a canton, or the entire town are divining in order to fill a vacancy in their ranks, and a middle or high-numbered Quej arrives on the first round, then they have found the proper candidate. If the question concerns the cause of an illness and the day Quej appears, the diviner has "mounted" the patient by sending the illness into him. If the illness is a serious one, the diviner who was hired by the patient (or by his family) may begin a series of 9 or 13 consecutive rituals (one each day) in which he will "mount" the evil diviner in order to return the illness to its source.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“Because of the strength of Quej, there are many individual, clan, canton, and town rituals performed by <em>chawanel</em> ("talkers"[meaning the priest-shamans]), on this day. A Quej day  is always selected for the October and January meetings of the town elders. On 1 and 8 Quej, which are the most important permission days for new calendar diviners, the priest-shaman goes to the shrines and informs the Mundo of the name of any novice he is going to present on the upcoming 8 Batz*. On 6 and 7 Quej, the "broom" (<em>mesebal</em>) ritual is performed at the lineage shrine called the winel. At this time, the lineage priest-shaman cleans the three parts of the winel, first the low part, then the high part, and finally the center (<em>cux*</em>, literally "heart"), also called sacramenta. Then, depending on whether it is planting or harvest time, he symbolically "plants" and prays for a good crop, or else he symbolically "cuts'' and gives thanks for the harvest. If 8 Quej falls soon after planting, then the town priest-shaman visits Quilaja, the sacred mountain of the east, to ask for rain for the new crop; on 11 Quej, he begins his regular circuit of all four sacred mountains by going to Quilaja. On 1, 2, 3, or 4 Quej, the unborn children of the currently pregnant wives of the patrilineage are "sown" and "planted" (<em>awexibal ticbal</em>) in the "foundation shrine" (<em>warabalja</em>) by the lineage priest-shaman.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>Q'anil signifies seed, brightness, and the golden and yellow hues associated with the four colors of maize and the planet Venus; it is the germ, the origin of life for plants and animals, and the guardian of all seeds. This day is special for asking for seeds, beginnings, an abundant harvest, and starting new projects. Stanzione (2006) links Q'anil to the South, the color yellow, abundance, and glory. Venus, embodied by Q'anil, has four periods (morning star - red; disappearing - yellow; evening star - black; disappearing - white) and is connected to the four colors of maize and the four corners of the sky-earth. The cultural hero Quetzalcoatl, who gave maize to humanity, is linked to Venus and maize. Q'anil reflects the four seasons of the Maya earth, mirroring the sky, making it a perfect day to ask for sustenance, water, wind, fertility, and to give thanks for abundance. It is auspicious for new projects and thanking for past blessings, calling us to observe the cosmos; humanity, though imperfect, can understand the cosmos, and like maize and Venus, we are cyclical beings of birth, life, death, and rebirth.</p>

                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Those born on Q'anil are great cultivators of the earth and fertile people in all respects. They are successful, intelligent, fortunate, and wealthy by nature and circumstance. They are also hard workers, direct, responsible, patient, intuitive, emotional, and harmonious. Tedlock (1982) suggests a baby born on Q'anil should become a day keeper (calendar diviner), a "feeder" (tzukunel) of the Mundo and the dead; a male might eventually become a priest-shaman for harvest rituals. Stanzione (2006) describes them as great 'Sustenance and Water' priests or priestesses, flowers of life, successful, intelligent, very fortunate, wealthy, hard-working, responsible, patient, intuitive, emotional, and harmonious. They make excellent counselors and administrators as well as agriculturalists, philosophers, doctors, mathematicians, musicians, writers, teachers, midwives, spiritual leaders, and defenders of peace.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Potential negative traits for Q'anil individuals include being rebellious and conflictive. They may easily fall ill and have trouble communicating their needs. They can also be arrogant, thinking they are better than others, gossipers causing disorder and war, and weak before obstacles. Stanzione (2006) concurs they can be rebellious and conflictive, easily fall ill, have difficulties communicating needs, and at their worst can be arrogant, believing themselves better than others, weak before obstacles, gossipers, calamitous, causing discord and war, and can have a "vicious" vice-filled nature.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“If a divinatory question concerns whether a woman will marry a man and Kanil appears, it means she is now ripe or mature (<em>kanaric*</em>), ready to marry him. If the question is for a merchant and the day Tziquin* (which indicates silver) appears in combination with Kanil, it means that the business deal is ripe, ready for picking. If the question concerns why an illness came to the client, Kanil means that he was not feeding (<em>tzukunic</em>) the Mundo or ancestors, who then sent the illness to him. If the question concerns whether the sick person will recover, Kanil * means "sunset" (<em>ixkanil*</em>). Just as the clouds become yellowish-red or orange and then darkness sets in, so the patient's illness is now well ripened, and they will soon die.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“The lineage rituals called "sowing and planting" begun on 6 and 7 Quej in the winel, have their final or "big day" (<em>nima kij*</em>) on 7 and 8 Kanil, respectively. On these days, the lineage priest-shaman, depending on whether planting or harvest time is closer, passes seeds saved from the previous year, or else fresh corn ears that have been chosen as seed ears for the next year, through the copal smoke. In so doing, he is symbolically feeding (<em>tzukunic</em>) both the Mundo and his own ancestors. Thus, one name for the priest-shaman is feeder (tzukunel).” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>Toj signifies payment, blood sacrifice, torch, offering, and karma; it represents the Grandfather Sun and the earth, Tojil (the sacred ceremonial fire), symbolizing the law of cause and effect and the debt to Mother Earth and all elements to the Ajaw (Heart of the Sky and Heart of the Earth). This energy opens space for gratefulness, creation, and existence, reminding us of our intertwined reality. Toj is the energy of retribution, helping reintegrate positive and negative life experiences and pay for blessings and challenges; it is the result of the law of action and reaction, akin to karma. Toj also means Tojil, the force of B'alam Ki'tze', who made offerings at humanity's dawn, bringing light. The ceremonial fire represents Father Sun, a space for communication with oneself and creators, capable of curing infirmities and liberating from negative energies. Toj is a day for offering to Tojil, leveling up with the supreme divinity, and reconciling with life and hope; it also symbolizes suffering due to sin, making it a day to offer, pay, give, and ask for strength and justice. </p>
                                <p>Molesky-Poz (2006) states this day symbolizes suffering due to sin, hence it is indicated to offer, pay, give, and ask for strength and justice. Stanzione (2006) associates Toj with the East and the color red, the burnt sacrifice at dawn, the blood drop offered for rain, and women's monthly blood as potential life. The round "drop" of Toj is the center of sacrificial fire and the Moon Goddess who was sacrificed; each lunar cycle asks for sacrifice as payment for life. Tojil was a K'iche' deity, the "spark of life," reflected in this day sign. It's a good day to resolve difficult situations, a day of altars and ceremonies where offerings are given for daily sacrifices to come to fruition and prosperity. Barrios (2015) adds it is a day for thanking and paying for our lives and benefits, and even for problems as they foster growth; it's for growing knowledge, breaking rigid structures, creating change, and developing new opportunities.</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>People born under Toj often suffer from "sins" yet are very helpful to others, sacrificing themselves for causes dear to them, usually family or nation. They are described as moon and water people, needing to live near water, and are strong, creative, community-oriented, imaginative, and make money wherever they go as perfect opportunists; they are also social and communicative. Stanzione (2006) concurs they are most helpful, sacrifice themselves for family or nation, and will turn against threats to loved ones; they are strong, creative, community-oriented, intelligent, imaginative, and make great warriors, priests, priestesses, farmers, and midwives. </p>
                                    <p>Barrios (2015) notes they are conceived under Imox with destiny sign No'j, bringing good auguries; their work involves paying the creator, making them good intermediaries. Despite past life slopes, they understand suffering is not their destiny. Many great spiritual guides are born under this sign, with vast experience directing people, making them excellent leaders. This sign brings protection and an intense life full of emotions and trials. They are emotional, hard workers, of strong character, responsible, very productive, home-bodies, concise, make rapid decisions, people of great virtues, accumulate much information, good agriculturalists, of productive energy, have a malleable character, are strong and respectable, strong in the face of challenges, can fortify themselves in many aspects of life, are methodical, love to help, know how to listen, and their counsel is certain.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>On the unfavorable side, Toj individuals can be vengeful in defense of loved ones, often angry, provoking fights, chronically ill, and fall easily into debt. Tedlock (1982) states a child born on Toj will be chronically ill and in debt much of their life, needing to be a constant client of diviners to live out a normal lifespan. Barrios (2015) advises they need to dominate their impulsivity and character, especially not letting volunteering be imposed on them, as this creates problems. They have a tendency to be very complicated and seem to attract fatality, but do not become fatalists. They can be somewhat impulsive and should sometimes take more time before making decisions, and can be extremely jealous and proud. They can be short-sighted, disquieted, sickly, tend toward infidelity and mental instability, run the risk of accidents, suffer problems and obstacles, and be possessive, destructive, proud, and vain, using their knowledge to supplement their ego, always wanting to be right and potentially manipulative.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“In divination, a low-numbered Toj indicates that one owes (<em>tojonic</em>) in the customs of the Mundo or the ancestors, and by extension one may owe a favor, work, or money to another person. If the client is ill, this means that the pain (<em>cäx</em>) is a punishment for this debt; the only way to cure it is to pay (<em>tojonic</em>) the Mundo, ancestors, or creditor what is owed, plus a penalty for the neglect. Since the number is low, the person will recover after paying. A middle-numbered Toj such as 7, 8, or 9 Toj indicates that someone in the client's family will die, and, as a consequence, the client will have to borrow money to hold the proper sort of wake. The day 13 Toj indicates that an ajmesa <em>lokej* ri camical, lokej ri sachical, lokej ri mac</em> ("cries for death, cries for disappearance, cries for sin") for the client. This is a serious matter that the diviner will turn over to an ajmesa, who will begin counter-witchcraft rites for the patient.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“On 1, 6, and 8 Toj, individual diviners visit the community shrines Paja* (on 1), Paclom (6), and Chuti* Sabal (8), in order to make up for any one, six, or eight days missed since the opening of the cycle of obligatory shrine visits on 1, 6, and 8 Quej. At this time, they burn all the copal and candles they have omitted plus a penalty for having not made the offerings on the proper days. Since these Toj days are each the thirteenth occurrence of an obligatory day of a given number, they are extremely powerful days for both evil and good. At Nima Sabal, 9 Toj is reserved for lineage priest-shamans. If a lineage priest-shaman should neglect his duties on these Toj days, particularly on 9 Toj, someone in his patrilineage would suffer serious punishment in the form of an illness or injury (cäx) from the Mundo.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>The energy of Tz'i' represents the dog, raccoon, or coyote and symbolizes a disequilibrium that has the potential to disorient wisdom and lead to destruction. This day is designated for seeking out the good, investigating laws, and establishing order and justice; it is a day imbued with authority, friendliness, and intelligence. Its direction is north, which is associated with the land of the dead, and its color is white. The dog serves as a guide for the dead to the Underworld and is a loyal companion, yet it also embodies the trickster and an eater of filth, driven by base hungers and lust. Tz'i' embodies intuition and is the hunter's reliable companion, known paradoxically as "amigo-enemigo" (friend and enemy) due to its nature of being both sweet and vicious, reflecting human tendencies toward lust and gluttony. </p>
                                <p>This day is considered appropriate for resolving legal problems, acknowledging divine intervention in various issues, interceding for individuals facing complications (particularly legal ones), and expressing gratitude for good guidance in life. It is also a time for orienting the destinies of the community, changing personal or collective courses, terminating unfavorable business deals, and reforming addictions such as alcoholism.</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Individuals born under Tz'i' are often authoritarian yet just and faithful, displaying protective and loving characteristics. They possess the ability to undo and correct problems and are recognized for being courageous, alert, kind, harmonious, honest, and respectful, making them good judges. They serve as excellent guides into the unknown and are trusted in times of need. These individuals can become great spiritual guides, adept at managing both material and spiritual laws; they are notably noble and practice social justice. They exhibit considerable patience and spiritual faith, are friendly and happy, and possess an investigative spirit, making them discoverers of great secrets. A lifelong duty for them is to protect and care for their families. They are also great thinkers and writers, dedicating themselves fully to their work or profession, and are good administrators or executors. </p>
                                    <p>Barrios (2015) notes they are good advice-givers with the virtue to intercede, reform, and help individuals untangle from complications, especially addictions, and are balanced people with a strong commitment to social justice. They are good secret keepers, loyal, strong, delicate, long-suffering, agile, and strategic, with a need to control everything around them. They are idealists who perform best in community service and are responsible employees. Their adventurous spirit leads them to search for ancestral connections, as family lineage is of utmost importance to them for understanding their current life situation. They have the potential for significant spiritual growth and are excellent at cutting out negative energies, bringing blessings and wealth to their communities, though they must learn to value themselves.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>On the unfavorable side, those born under Tz'i' may want to exert their own authority according to their own rules. At times, their character can be insupportable; they can be angry and may enjoy gossip or spying, needing to feel in control to avoid insecurity. There is a tendency towards infidelity, and without care, they can become vicious, especially if alcoholism is an issue. They may lack good self-judgment, potentially creating enemies and fomenting discord between people, and can be vindictive and vengeful. Mayan-Calendar.com lists potential negative traits such as being addicts, sexual deviants, arrogant, problem makers, violent fighters, insecure, emotionally unstable, unlucky, easily confused, and weak. Tedlock (1982) suggests a child born on Tzi' could be a confused, weak, unlucky person preoccupied with sexual relations, potentially leading to promiscuity or prostitution, and that such impurity and weakness would make them unsuitable for training as a diviner. Their major trial is their pride and defending their word in situations that could lead to ultimate consequences.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“In divination, a low-numbered Tzi indicates <em>catziyari* chi, catziyari wäch</em> ("one loses confidence"literally "the mouth is uncertain, the face is uncertain"). This indicates that the person wants to do something one minute and does not want to do it the next. The person is uncertain and discouraged. A middle-numbered Tzi indicates that the novice has dirtied (<em>tzilonic</em>) him or herself by making love on one of the permission days, or else that a man and woman are exchanging jealous words (<em>tziyalaj tzij</em>) because of a lack of faithfulness on one or the other's part. A high-numbered Tzi indicates that the person has committed a serious sexual sin (<em>tzilonic</em>) such as incest, adultery, or sodomy. In a divination for a marriage, Tzi indicates that the woman already has a lover; consequently, all plans for marriage are stopped. No business deal or journey would be initiated on Tzi, which is a weak, indifferent day. (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“The only Tzi day used for ritual purposes is 7 Tzi, which is the mixprix or eve of 8 Batz*. On this crucial day, the novice is formally quizzed about their recent dreams, and the teacher tells any of his own; the latter will then make his final decision as to whether or not to go ahead with the initiation. He asks if the novice has lost confidence (<em>catziyaric</em>), or is willing to go through with the initiation. When he has assured himself that the novice is decisive, he immediately begins the initiation ritual, which will be publicly completed on the next two days, 8 Batz and 9 E.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>The energy of B'atz' signifies the thread, the placenta, and the count thread of time, marking our origin and continuation with the past. Molesky-Poz (2006) explains that this energy oriented the first wise ones in forming humanity and represents the ultimate end of the universe, making it a good day to initiate any activity. Stanzione (2006) describes B'atz' as the "Uncle" of our Primate Ancestry, embodying the artist, musician, day-keeper, diviner, trickster, actor, scribe, and storyteller of all that is past, present, and future. It is the thread (b'atz) one unravels to see earthly antiquity, with the monkey ancestor representing a past where creators were forgotten, leading to transformation. B'atz' incarnates the unraveling of time and human development through evolution, a day to ask for ancestral memory and revelations. </p>
                                <p>Barrios (2015) views B'atz' as the spiritual connection and history woven with time, the principle of life, infinite time, and unity, symbolizing cosmic phenomena and original wisdom. It represents the interweaving and unrolling of time, evolution, and human life, with time depicted as a thread rolled around a reed under the Earth, embodying the divinity that creates sky, earth, life, and wisdom.</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>People born under B'atz' are often fun-loving individuals who enjoy goofing off and entertaining others; they are also tenacious, persisting until they achieve their goals. They are considered masters of the arts, intelligent, good-hearted, judicious, and sage-like, with a strong connection to their ancestors. They tend to teach and lead by example, often becoming charismatic leaders, and have an appreciation for nature and personal quests within it. Mayan-Calendar.com suggests they are lucky in business, marriage, and life, often becoming automatically rich and respected. </p>
                                    <p>Stanzione (2006) adds that they make powerful ajq'ij (daykeepers) as well as midwives and musicians, and are natural merchants, defenders of justice, artists, singers, dancers, weavers, agriculturalists, priests, and priestesses. Barrios (2015) describes them as calm individuals who frequently solve their problems, good listeners imbued with the power of the Ajaw (Lord), and transmitters of fair and orderly judgments. They possess significant spiritual power, generate many ideas, are generous, active, dynamic, good defenders of their community, have strong character, well-defined acts, and profound love for their family. Tedlock (1982) states a child born on B'atz will be lucky in business, marriage, and life, easily accumulating money, animals, harvest, and children.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Despite their strengths, those born under B'atz' can have trouble solving their own problems. They may also become hard-hearted, overly proud, arrogant, or foolish. Barrios (2015) notes that while they can be proud and arrogant, this may stem from underlying insecurity, and they might make jokes at the expense of those similar to them. There is also a potential for them to become very ambitious, conceited fools.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“If the question concerns whether to make a trip, business deal, or ask for a woman, B’atz of any number is affirmative: one will spin or roll up luck, business, or a marriage arrangement. The higher the number, the luckier and better the situation. If the question concerns why a person is ill, B’atz means <em>at falta cho ri chac patan, at falta cho wa Mundo</em>, “you lack before the divining seeds, you lack before the Mundo”. The higher the number, the greater the lack of proper offerings and prayers.”  (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“Two rituals performed on Batz * are the asking (tzonoj*) part of the native marriage ceremony and the initiation of a daykeeper or diviner. Forty days before marriage (<em>culanem*</em>), the groom, his "road guide" (<em>camal* be</em>), and his family all go to the house of the prospective bride, carrying sticks, called <em>botzoj*</em>, that are elaborately wound with flowers. This ritual, which involves hours of formal oratory called <em>tzonoj</em>, is most frequently performed on a low-numbered Batz, although Came, Akabal*, and Aj are also possible. The marriage itself will be performed on a day of the same name, but with the next higher number; thus a successful tzonoj falling on 1 Batz will be followed by a wedding forty days later, on 2 Batz. On 8 Batz, a novice diviner is publicly presented with his divining seeds, first at Chuti* Sabal and then at Paja*, at the particular hearths where the teacher and his wife received their own divining paraphernalia. This is parallel to the matrimonial "asking" in that the new diviner and their divining paraphernalia are thereafter considered to be husband and wife. Forty days later, on 9 Batz, the "marriage" of the diviner and the divining seeds is completed with a formal giving of thanks at Nima Sabal. (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>The energy of E' signifies the road, destiny, and tooth, representing the good, straight, and long road, as well as the nerves in the human body and the development of history. Stanzione (2006) explains a transformation in meaning from "tooth" or "predator" to "road" (B'e), though suggesting both meanings can reveal themselves. The "tooth" aspect evokes opportunistic animals and the sharpness or edge of things that can cut us. E' is considered a "toothy" day, potentially biting back, making it a day to be cautious in work and travel. It's seen as a good day for merchants to seek more profit and to clear one's path of obstructive officials or thieves. It is also a day to ask for protection of the harvest from various threats and to clear one's path of envy and temptations. Barrios (2015) states it is the best day to begin a business, conduct negotiations, finalize contracts, and is highly auspicious for journeys and communication, especially with those outside the community or country.</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Individuals born on E' are often travelers who are very organized, nice, hard-working, opportunistic, and intuitive. They love "the hunt" but also cherish home, acting as protectors and pathfinders who can foresee obstacles by thinking ahead. They are generally blessed with a good, long, healthy life. According to Barrios (2015), natives of E' are leaders, diplomats, skilled in conversation, knowledgeable in many areas, and experts in politics. They are respected, adaptable, obedient, fond of travelling, good navigators, determined, and successful in business. Strong and determined, they share their wealth with the community, are very creative, natural leaders, great writers, orators, and storytellers who love history. </p>
                                    <p>They are courteous, especially with younger generations, enjoy sharing experiences, possess a rejuvenating inner fire, great empathy, and tolerance. Their sensitivity often leads them to surround themselves with art, and they may become great artists themselves, manifesting genuine care for their neighbors and being very good-hearted. Tedlock (1982) indicates that a male child born on E, especially in an E year, might become a lineage priest-shaman, while a female child might become a midwife, both destined for a good, long, healthy life. Stanzione (2006) describes them as merchants who see trends and procurement sources, and they may become 'Sustenance and Water' intercessors, making great merchants, explorers, hunters, and researchers.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Potential negative traits for those born on E' include being solitary, fickle, and prone to tantrums. Barrios (2015) mentions that natives of E' like to be recognized for their favors and have restless spirits needing movement and travel. While they accumulate wealth, they also tend to lose it, being speculators who constantly change their appearance and are futuristic, reckless, and adventurous. This sign is one of the most enamored and can be very lucky in love, often needing many relationships and not being the most faithful, though they can be content at home if comfortable and not beleaguered, generally making good parents. Despite being communicative, they can be hard to understand due to an inner shell protecting their vulnerable and distrustful heart. They can also fight ideologically with enemies, be envious of those with means, have a propensity to grave infirmities, and be manipulative.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“In divination, E generally indicates the road (<em>ri be</em>), which, as my teacher explained, means more than "the road you can see with your eyes," for it is the road of life. In a destiny divination, the meaning of E depends on the other days appearing with it. For example, if Imöx which indicates a confused, crazy, possessed condition immediately proceeds E in the results, it means "he has lost his road" (<em>xasachom ube</em>). On the other hand, a combination of E and Quej would indicate either that "we be guided on our road" (<em>cama* la kabe</em>) by the lineage priest-shaman, or that the client's destiny is to become a priest-shaman. However, if the person is ill and the question concerns who caused the illness, then the combination of Quej and E would indicate that a lineage priest-shaman placed a trap in the client's road.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“In an E year, each of the eighteen occurrences of the day E is celebrated with firecrackers, copal, and feasting at many locations in the municipality. The days 4 and 6 E are the eve (<em>mixprix</em>) of the ceremonies in the foundation shrine (<em>warabalja</em>) of both the canton and the patrilineage. The ceremony at the foundation shrine for people begins on 6 E, while that at the foundation for animals begins on 4 E. On these days, the patrilineage priest-shaman goes first to Paja *, the low, watery public shrine, and then to the low part of his own lineage's foundation shrine. The day 9 E is the final day or "big day" (<em>nima kij*</em>) for the initiation of a novice daykeeper, which takes place at Nima Sabal. On this day, the novice formally begins <em>ri utzilaj be, ri calominaj be, ri nimalaj be</em> ("the good road, the straight road, the long road") of their service to the people.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>The energy of Aj represents the cornstalk, the reed, and the young ear of corn (elote), signifying the home and family. Molesky-Poz (2006) states that Aj is related to triumphing over all forms of illness, even death, and is a symbol of resurrection. Stanzione (2006) describes Aj with its direction as East and color red, representing green growth, abundance, sustenance, the milpa (cornfield), the tender head of maize, and the Maize God incarnate as a beautiful young lord. This stage of maize is vulnerable to predation, wind, and rain or lack thereof, making Aj a day to call for protection of crops and children. The Popol Vuh's Hero Twins planted maize as a sign of their departure and eventual rebirth, reflecting the Maya identity as "Ixim Winaq" (beings of maize). </p>
                                <p>Maize requires human work, priestly sacrifice and prayers for ideal natural elements, and women's hands for its transformation into sustenance; Aj commemorates this sacred and secular way of Mayan life. This day also embodies telepathy, clairvoyance, signs, body movements, dreams, intuition, sacred speech, inspiration, and spiritual power, relating to life, plants, and their waters, making it good for asking for rain, crops, children, and growth in any form. Barrios (2015) notes Aj as a day for protecting the home, animals, and plants, providing good weather, great fruit, and harvest. It's an energy that brings revival, the return home, and marks life, facilitating nature's restoration and harmony with others.</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>People born under Aj are generally nice, attentive, helpful, and thankful, with a tendency to multiply everything they contact. They are generous, especially with family, and community-oriented. They are often perfectionists, talented with plants and agriculture, honest, and able to keep secrets. Mayan-Calendar.com also states they are lucky in love, business, and family, and good at raising animals and children. Tedlock (1982) suggests any child born on Aj will be lucky in love, business, and family life; a male child could be a good priest-shaman, and a female child a responsible mother and wife, especially lucky with raising animals and children. Stanzione (2006) adds they make good researchers and investigators, are very nice, attentive, helpful, and thankful, and perfectionists who enjoy strong experiences. They are very honest and reliable secret-keepers.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>On the negative side, those born under Aj can be prone to illness and easily bothered by people. They might experience marital problems and can make themselves hard to understand. Stanzione (2006) mentions they suffer from illnesses and often have many enemies due to their successful nature, and can be obsessive and easily bothered by people and situations, often needing special attention because they make themselves hard to understand.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“In divination, Aj usually indicates that the answer lies "in the house, in the place" (<em>pa ri ja, pa ri colibal*</em>). For example, if the question concerns the cause of an illness, a low-numbered Aj would indicate that a recent fight within the patrilineage (<em>pa ri alaxic</em>) was the cause, while a high number would indicate a fight in the distant past, perhaps before the sick person was even born. If 7 Aj appears, it specifically means that a dead priest-shaman of the client's own lineage has been neglected or offended and has sent illness to the sufferer.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“On 1 and 8 Ajas on 1 and 8 Quej, Ajpu, and Came, all of which are permission days specifically for the divination paraphernalia the priest-shaman visits the public shrines in order to ask the ancestors to help his student learn to divine properly. 5 and 7 Aj are the second or "broom" (<em>mesebal</em>) days following 4 and 6 E in the respective ceremonies of the foundations of the animals and of the people. On 7 Aj, in the ceremony for the people, the lineage priest-shaman first visits Chuti * Sabal, where he leaves paraffin candles for all known deceased priest-shamans of his patrilineage; then he goes and leaves vigil lights in the church for these same dead. On 8 and 9 Aj (and 8 and 9 Ajmac) the confraternities do the "washing of clothes" (<em>chajbal* atziak*</em>) for the saints in the parish church and cemetery chapel. On 11 Aj, the town priest-shaman from Los Cipréses visits Tamancu, the sacred mountain of the south, and then returns to offer paraffin candles on Paclom (in the center) to all dead lineage, canton, and town priest-shamans.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>The energy of I'x symbolizes strength, the jaguar (or tiger), and the sacred appeal of the earth, representing vigor and the creative forces of the universe. It is considered a day of feminine energy and also represents the Maya altar, the place of the earth's sacred power, embodying the day of mountains and plains. Stanzione (2006) associates I'x with the mortal North and the color deathly White, describing it as the Lord of the Night, Night Sun, Lord of the Animals, Hearth of the Mountain, and Lord of the Underworld – predation incarnate. I'x embodies the magical powers of the transforming sorcerer (nawal) who stalks the dream world as a nightwalker of the underworld, a sharp, insightful, and completely "sensed" being of the intuitive Night world. It represents the warring sorcerer in shamanic battles for human hearts and souls, and the violent yet nurturing feminine energy of the Earth Mother in her feline form. The jaguar's mirror-like golden eyes reflect the sun's power, making it a great huntress and a divine being, the nawal of powerful shamans and rulers, possessing a dual nature: violent and destructive, yet nurturing and creative – Mother Earth incarnate.</p>
                                <p>Barrios (2015) describes I'x as jaguar or tiger, representing feminine and feline energy, the altar of feminine energy, the force of magic, astuteness, intelligence, Mother Earth, and the spiritual protector of hills, plains, and mountains. It signifies the universe's creative forces and is a day of High Magic, under which great mages and prophets have been born, linked to the four B'alameb' (jaguars), mythic Man-Gods who have guided the Mayan world. It's a special day for gratitude for the force and positive energy of spirit and community guides, and for the good lives of animals. It relates to sensibility, and is fortuitous for establishing relationships based on clarity, favorable for investigations, and brings good intuition; one might dedicate it to magic-scientific techniques like divination.</p>

                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Individuals born under I'x are described as practical, intelligent, astute, patient, decisive, generous, strong, and energetic. They are good with animals and can be powerful warriors. They are hunters by nature with a notable sexual appetite, and are often wealthy and responsible. Barrios (2015) characterizes them as strong, brave, vigorous, and passionate lovers, who in love are like kings, always finding someone to comply with their desires. The feminine energy is favorable for developing their magic powers; they are devoted to success in tending animals and agriculture, quick decision-makers, fighters, and dreamers. Their destiny is unpredictable, with an entirely feline energy making women under this sign very feminine. They are innate hunters, loving, and fearless. As parents, they are great protectors of their family's security. Astuteness defines them, giving them boldness, though they remain realistic and prudent (if sometimes selfish). They have the capability and agility to act, combined with the strength and energy to wait, love popularity, are fond of mountains, and generally enjoy good health, confronting life's problems with bravery. Tedlock (1982) notes a child born on I'x will have a close relationship with the Mundo (Earth deity), resulting in wealth, as precious materials belong to the Mundo.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>On the unfavorable side, I'x individuals can be over-bearing, vain, and arrogant, needing to be the center of attention. They may be prone to sudden illness and can be angry. Barrios (2015) mentions they hold their problems close and find it very difficult to share their difficulties. They can be presumptuous and can easily change their life's course towards revenge or harming someone who has wronged them. They are also easily swayed by the seven vices: pride, ambition, envy, lying, crime against the community, ingratitude, and ignorance. According to Tedlock (1982), they may also suffer many physical ailments, which the Mundo inflicts suddenly with slight cause.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“In a divination concerning a sick client, a low-numbered I’x indicates that the Mundo will withdraw the illness or financial trouble he has inflicted on the person. A middle or high-numbered I’x, however, indicates that the trouble was sent by the Mundo, that the Mundo is the enemy. In this case, the only way to withdraw the illness is to change one’s relationship with the Mundo. Since I’x is a secretary to the Mundo, the best way to do this is to pay a fine to the secretary, who will give the money – in the form of copal, candles, sugar, and flowers, to the Mundo.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“[On 6 and 8 I’x…] the lineage priest-shaman first goes to Ch’uti Sabal, which is considered the mother and father of all the foundation shrines. There, they pray and offer copal to the Mundo, since I’x is the day specifically dedicated to the Mundo… [On 6 and 7 I’x…] the lineage priest-shaman […] asks the Mundo for money to buy the land and materials necessary to build a house. If a house is currently being built somewhere within his patrilineage, he then goes to the site to perform the house “planting” rituals, which protect the house from being hit by lightning, dissolved in a rainstorm, collapsed by an earthquake, or washed away in a flood.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>The energy of Tz'ikin, meaning "bird" (eagle, quetzal, or condor), signifies fortune, wisdom, and knowledge. It is the day of the one who sees all things from above, mediating between the Creator and humans, representing space, air, light, clouds, cold, and the warmth of the Heart of Heaven and Heart of Earth. It is a day to cry for or ask for money and success. Stanzione (2006) aligns Tz'ikin with the West and the color black, linking it to the Jaguar-Eagle warriors whose strength brought wealth through sacrificial victims. The day embodies sky, brilliance, wealth, splendor, beauty, power, strength, and freedom; it's a good day to repay the gods for sustenance and ask for more. Bird feathers symbolized abundance and aesthetic perfection in ancient Mesoamerica, with birds acting as messengers of the gods, providing signs and communication about life, yet also as thieves of crops. </p>
                                <p>Tz'ikin is a good day to ask for protection for milpas (cornfields) and domestic fowl. Tz'ikin also means "penis," manifesting fertility and the wealth it brings; it's a day to give thanks for earthly collections and sacrifice for what is to come. Barrios (2015) describes it as the best day for love, for giving thanks for abundance (individual and communal), and for protecting businesses. It's a day for appreciating partners and friends, and for thriving in intuition, vision, precognition, and dream revelations.</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>People born under Tz'ikin are creators of their own destiny, characterized as intelligent, analytical, and generous. They have a love for business and art, are intuitive, very spiritual, and ambitious. They can be mystics and visionaries, crying out for and desiring everything necessary for a good life, both material and spiritual. Tedlock (1982) notes that a child born on Tz'ikin will desire all essentials for a good life and, if called by the Mundo, will train as a daykeeper, becoming an elegant prayermaker much in demand for both good and evil desires. A male might become a priest-shaman, helping people prosper. Stanzione (2006) describes them as happy and generous individuals who love business and art, analytical and intelligent, aware of present opportunities, and formers of their own destiny. Intuitive by nature, they can be very spiritual, potentially becoming mystics, visionaries, and seers, good at business but sometimes fickle.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Potential negative traits for Tz'ikin individuals include being envious and often using trickery or cheating to obtain their desires. They can also be fickle in their likes and dislikes. Stanzione (2006) echoes that they can be overly ambitious due to envy and may use trickery.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“In divination concerning the cause of an illness, Tziquin* would indicate that the person had an enemy who cried or asked for (<em>xasiquitalic*, xatzonotalic*</em>) the financial ruin of the client, ruin that the illness could cause if not quickly cured. A low-numbered Tziquin would indicate that the client had a recent enemy, while a high-numbered Tziquin would indicate an enemy of some years. If the divination concerns a business trip, Tziquin would indicate a financial success; the higher the number the greater the success. In divining during the training of a novice daykeeper, Tziquin means that this person desires and cries for (<em>oketalic* siquitalic*</em>) knowledge.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“7 and 8 Tziquin are the "big days" for the mebil shrines. On these days, the lineage priest-shaman crys for, asks for (<em>oketalic siquitalic</em>) material blessings in the form of money (<em>pwak</em>) for buying the necessities of life for all members of his patrilineage. Tziquin, like Cat, is a secretary-treasurer for the Mundo, but Tziquin consecutively serves as secretary to the two most powerful and violent Mam, namely Quej and Ik, who are just as likely to destroy material well-being as to create it. The crying and asking (<em>oketalic siquitalic</em>) at the shrines on 1, 6, and 8 Tziquin during a Quej or Ik * year is for protection from these powerful, cruel Mam.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>Ajmaq signifies the people of the clan, sinners, or human beings, and is associated with pardon and the dead ancestors. Molesky-Poz (2006) describes it as a symbol of moral forces, a day to remember dead ancestors and ask pardon for sins before the sky, Ajaw (the Creator), the earth, and the ancestors, who guide the present and help secure the future. Stanzione (2006) explains it as a day of ancestral people perceived paradoxically as god-like yet guilty for humanity's fallen state; humans are "ajmaq," sinners who have lost the path of perfection, with hunger and sex being the roots of this fallen state. June bugs, also called ajmaq, are seen as souls of ancestors returning to provide water for maize so their "replacements" can live. </p>
                                <p>Barrios (2015) states it's a favorable day to give and receive pardon, maintain harmony, and uphold the word, message, ancestral lineages, and energies emanating from living bodies as auras. Ajmaq carries the energy of the Mother of All Errors, offenses, and irresponsibility towards gods, earth, and ancestors; it is the Earth and the spirit of ancestors, where "Maq" (sins and vices) is a curtain of smoke hiding the other world. It is also a day of pardon and introspection, traditionally a day to stay put, reflect on actions and consequences, and only leave to make offerings, ask forgiveness, and attend ceremonies.</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Individuals born under Ajmaq are often studious and analytic, great strategists who are tenacious in all they do. They are respectful of others, prudent, and intelligent, capable of being brave and visionary, open to confrontation yet impenetrable in essence. They make good event coordinators and tend to say what is on their mind but not necessarily their heart, which can make them appear cold or unaffectionate. They possess great memories and a keen interest in their past and ancestors, respecting tradition and having a good sense of humor. They tend to fall in and out of love but always have love in their lives, are lucky in business, and are usually forgiven their sins, allowing them to continue prospering. </p>
                                    <p>Barrios (2015) notes the Ajmaq has the virtue to go slowly through life and reach their goals, with a strong character that can anger quickly. They have a special talent to be well-liked by everyone. The energy of "sib'" (candle), from Yucateco tradition, signifies inner light and the divine spark within. They are defenders of their people, act with prudence, relate well to all kinds of people, and dominate cosmic force. They are analytical, recognize the consequences of their actions, and have the Ancestors as guides, counting on their experience and intelligence to fortify them materially and spiritually. Tedlock (1982) suggests a child born on Ajmaq will be lucky in business, and though potentially irresponsible as a spouse or parent, their sins will be forgiven so their family prospers.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Potential negative traits for Ajmaq individuals include irresponsibility, lies, jealousy, and vice. They may be irresponsible as spouses and parents, make mistakes, and suffer as a result. Barrios (2015) mentions that despite a duality of curiosity and prudence, it is not difficult to find them trapped in vices. While sincere, they can saddle others with their faults. For their bad conduct, they tend to blame other people and can be delicate, undisciplined, liars, jealous, or irresponsible. They struggle with making decisions easily due to seeing multiple benefits and consequences at once.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“In divination for an illness, Ajmaq indicates that the person has sinned against a member of their own patrilineage and that they must ask pardon before their spouse and parents. The lower the number, the more minor or recent the sin, while the higher the number, the older or more serious the offense. If the question concerns whether a particular person will marry the client, Ajmaq is a positive answer: they will join the patrilineage.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“1, 6, 8, and 9 Ajmaq days are when priest-shamans visit the community shrines to ask pardon before the Tiox (God), Nantat (the Ancestors), and Mundo (the earthly world) for fighting within the patrilineage. Ajmaq is a good day for the “planting” in the foundation shrine of a new but as yet unborn child of the patrilineage.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>No'j represents knowledge, insight, and wisdom, symbolizing the connection of the Universal Cosmic Mind with the human intellect. It signifies the movement of the Sky and Earth, cave or cavern, and mass, embodying the power of intelligence, ideas, thoughts, the brain, and movement. No'j governs the mind, knowledge, and good memory, facilitating the interaction between the limitless expansion of the infinite and the limitations of rigid reality imposed on human beings. Nobility is the primary virtue brought by No'j, making this day a standard-bearer for patience, prudence, and sublime love; renunciation, bringing clarity, guides life. The challenge lies in transforming knowledge and experience into wisdom with the Ajaw's blessing, as accumulating knowledge without humility can lead to confusion. No'j brings the power of intergalactic and interdimensional communication, allowing the sublime to manifest through art and enabling voyages through space and time via the mind, granting action and knowledge of spirits beyond through the mystery of "Najt" (the spiral weave of Space-Time). </p>
                                <p>Great wisemen and mages, inheritors of Q'uq'umatz's lineage, have been born under this sign, which activates the positive spirit of this dimension and contains synchronicity, great vibration, and collective memory. Molesky-Poz (2006) links No'j to wisdom, creativity, intelligence, the earth's movement (like an earthquake), and the creativity of Ajaw. Stanzione (2006) associates No'j with the East and the color red, representing wisdom and knowledge combined with insight from the earth – life experience united with intuition, reflection, and ancestral memory. It's a day to ask for appropriate knowledge, understanding of human struggle, and to invoke ancestral memory for the benefit of the living and dead, guiding movement towards a good future. As a day of the Earth, much knowledge comes directly from her, complemented by sky knowledge of the eternal, fostering wisdom that we are all interconnected on this Earth and must protect it. Earth transforms through movement, sometimes calm growth, other times destruction, ultimately deciding humanity's place.</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Individuals born under No'j are connected to the Earth and are described as wise, intelligent people with curative powers. They are conservative with resources, efficient, sure of themselves, and oriented towards community service, exerting a positive influence on others. They are idealistic about justice, creative and innovative thinkers, and possess a strongly masculine character. Barrios (2015) highlights their qualities of wisdom and intelligence, noting they are often "aq'omanela'" (people dedicated to medicine), dreamers, brave, and prudent. They have good character, are comprehensive in matrimony, good students, and fight for justice, with nobility giving way to power being their greatest challenge. This day governs experiments, human sciences, and studies of the human mind. </p>
                                    <p>In love, they are most noble and perseverant, faithful by nature, enjoying calm relationships and giving partners space. Though naturally conservative, they can break with tradition, have advanced ideas, and fight for them, being idealistic dreamers whose main problem is grounding themselves in reality; they are extremely trusting. They are conducive to change, transmit security, and are intuitive and prophetic about new ways of life, with clarity of being and a search for the profound marking their existence. They are great truth-seekers, unresting researchers, avid readers, and find their communicative expression through art. </p>
                                    <p>Stanzione (2006) adds they are good administrators of resources, often romantic and idealistic, and can become daykeepers, diviners, artists, doctors, agriculturalists, spiritual leaders, humanists, and judges. Tedlock (1982) states a child born on No'j will be a creative and innovative thinker, an excellent daykeeper, and potentially a civil or religious leader due to their problem-solving ability; it's a masculine day imbuing a masculine character regardless of birth gender.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>On the unfavorable side, those born under No'j can be overly curious and arrogantly self-sufficient, independent to a fault. Barrios (2015) notes that because they are so sincere, they can hurt with their words and may lack the astuteness to reach their objectives. They can also tend toward infidelity, be very individualistic, inflexible, too talkative, arrogant, or conceited, and may need rigid structure or become co-dependent.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“In divination, the day No’j in combination with other day names means both <em>chomanic</em> (“to think” in the sense of a calculative, argumentative, troubled train of thought) and <em>no’jinic</em> (“to think” in the sense of creative or mediative thought). For example, in a divination about an illness, Kan and No’j would indicate that one should think about which <em>ajnawal mesa</em> caused this illness. Aj and No’j or Ajmaq and No’j would direct thought to family members, which K’at and No’j would direct thought to one’s debts to another person or to the Mundo.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“On each occurrence of No’j during a No’j year,  the priest-shaman may think of novel solutions to long-standing family, canton, or town problems. Although there are no obligatory visits to community or family shrines on No’j, one could visit the community shrine on any low-numbered No’j day in order to give thanks for a solution to a problem or else for a new blanket design.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>A Good Day To:</h4>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>Tijax represents the cut, separation, the knife, the pyramid, and healing or harmonizing on physical, mental, psychic, and spiritual planes; it signifies the liberation of the physical body to transform into the spiritual. This sign brings the test of cutting out what doesn't serve or limits us, symbolizing the obsidian knife, the double-edged knife, and the warrior's strength and power. Its energy is strong, often drastic, bringing revelations and fleeting images, possessing the power of thunder and lightning that forms the "Chay" stone (obsidian). Obsidian, black and transparent, cutting yet fragile, is difficult to polish but highly valued for divination, being a fundamental stone of divination and war. It signifies directed thought, intelligence, the planet's internal force (magma), volcanic power, and the catalyzer of sacred fire. Tijax represents the double-edged knife where positive and negative converge, making it unclear where one ends and the other begins. It has the power to cut through mysteries or open routes to other dimensions. It also means pain, suffering, and sadness, like an arrow or lance, bringing danger, making it the best day to purify the balance between positive and negative workings. </p>
                                <p>Tijax represents a grotto (Casa del Chay) in Xib'alb'a, a place of punishment, with upcoming tests being one's dramaticness, intolerance, impositions, pride, and ego. On day Tijax, gratitude is given for the wisdom of minerals and crystals, and for the energy of synchronicity, orientation, navigation, and its liberal, rational, and controversy-provoking force. It represents earthly force expressed through earthquakes and tremors, indicating energy for change or collapse, a necessary "shake" to comprehend our true path. </p>
                                <p>Molesky-Poz (2006) describes Tijax as the obsidian knife, signifying suffering and pain, the emblem of the sacrifice god, reminding of ancestral suffering, and is the day of healers. Stanzione (2006) associates it with the North, bone-white color, the devourer of hearts on sacrificial altars, a symbol of sacrifice carrying pain, danger, and suffering, but also the power to avoid them. It's a strong, tough day, bad for planting or consequential actions unless on altars of sacrifice; good for repaying life's debt and keeping death/disease away, a day to free oneself from slavery and cut binding knots of anguish. Obsidian flints on altars connect to ancient knappers and rain gods' lightning bolts, manifestations of ancestral memory; fear of the blade is respect for life's ordering forces, asking for protection. Tijax asks for insight, protection from envy, and cutting away worries, fights, or thoughts, healing life's wounds to move freely and make a clean cut with the past.</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>People born on Tijax are strong and courageous, often relied upon for difficult tasks. They are careful and nurturing, sometimes sacrificing and suffering to right worldly wrongs. As great collaborators and problem solvers, they are often called to help with reconciliation and possess a gift for healing. They tend to be good at sports. Barrios (2015) states those born in Tijax are protectors of justice, can cure incurable diseases, and are brave and tireless. They are delicate, possess great ideas and talent, and are rational on one hand while being intuitive, imaginative, and dreamers on the other. </p>
                                    <p>They are judicious and just, though drastic, easily offended, and can end long-term relationships abruptly and cuttingly. They are good students, acquiring fortune through their own strength, inheritance, or marriage. They are great healers, with much power in their hands, making especially good surgeons. They accrue power and fame and are good-hearted; though traditionalist, they are open to new propositions, especially in mystic arts where they have much experience. They value luxury and a good life, craving much but sharing everything, give value to mental things, are diligent, and have responsibility from an early age. </p>
                                    <p>They are leaders, intelligentsia, intermediaries, and great in public relations. They are optimistic in the face of difficult life situations, good, strong, unbeaten in adversity, collaborators, and knowers/practicers of love. They dislike acting with violence, can become spiritual guides, are good friends, possess good body language, and are clairvoyant, prognosticators, intuitive, honest, spiritual, and rigid. They take others' problems as their own, are tireless workers, and strict where necessary.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>On the negative side, Tijax individuals can be vengeful, violent, resentful, and cruel when their heart turns against another. They can be both victims and promoters of lies and slander, and may pick fights or be solitary. Tedlock (1982) suggests a child born on Tijax will be a victim and promoter of political, sexual, and religious lies, slanders, and fights, making them unsuitable as daykeepers due to weakness from disputes. Barrios (2015) notes that in love, they struggle to manage relationships as they dislike formalizing them, and when they do, they generally seek a submissive partner due to their dominant character. </p>
                                    <p>They can suffer much and be vengeful, suffering infirmities, accidents, litigations, and gossip, needing to make offerings to avoid fines. They can be angry and bilious, sensitive, delicate, and vengeful, with a tendency to make bad friendships and act violently. They are given to suffering calamities, can be proud, always wanting to be right and victorious, and may lose good jobs due to their drama. There's a tendency to have lovers but not much family, and they are sharp in their decisions regarding feelings and work.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“In divination, Tijax indicates that a missionary is trying to engage one in a religious dispute (<em>choj</em>), or else that one's spouse is angry and jealous about attentions paid to another man or woman. The higher the number, the more serious the dispute, ending (at 13) with the jailing of one or both parties and a public scandal. In divining for a marriage, journey, or business, Tijax would indicate that a fight would result. In an illness divination, Tijax would indicate slander, whether by an enemy or by the patient himself, as the cause.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“1 and 8 Tijax are two of the twenty-one permission days for the novice daykeeper. At this time, the student is reminded of the slanderous "trampling lips" (<em>xakabal chiaj</em>) of their friends, who might call them a fool or a witch for undergoing the training. They will do this either because they are jealous that the Mundo has not chosen them, or else because the Protestant missionaries or the Catholic priest have filled them with lies about "pagans" each Sunday morning. On 1, 6, 8, and 9 Tijax, daykeepers visiting the community shrines may ask that religious slanderers fight (<em>choj *</em>) among themselves rather than with them. On the same visit, they also ask that there be no jealousy or concealment (<em>kabanic*</em>) over financial or sexual matters among members of their own patrilineage.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>Kawoq signifies storm, encompassing lawsuit, difficulties, problems, and bad luck; it represents lightning and thunder, celestial dragons, and rain. It acknowledges earthly problems but emphasizes that, like the first grandparents, obstacles can be conquered to achieve humanity's work. It is a day for judges, lawyers, and those interceding for health or an end to problems. Stanzione (2006) associates Kawoq with the west, the setting sun, and the stormy color black, describing it as a feminine day sign with masculine attributes. The root "oq" or "uq" relates to the Old Maya Rain Woman, Chak Chel', the Mother Goddess of Rain, curing, and weaving (Ixchel). </p>
                                <p>Kawoq is the lightning and rain storm, the nawal of rain, a sky deity, caretaker and destroyer of the milpa, with its sign in fire serpents of thunder, lightning, and royal scepters. This deified rain is also known as K'awil, a male deity of lightning, rain, deluge, and kingship. Rain, wind, and fire serpents gave life to mushrooms (food of the gods) from tapir and deer feces, which provided insights into the sacred cosmos as children of Kawoq. There are many types of rain (one-footed, deer, rabbit, vulture, fire, wind, flint, woodpecker), all governed by Kawoq, also known as Jun Raqan (Hurricane). Tijax anticipates Kawoq (lightning before rain), and Kawoq anticipates Ajpu (the supreme maize deity); it is a powerful day as the fertile rain feeds the maize from which Maya people and civilization are created. Barrios (2015) states Kawoq is the best day to work for the common good (community, house, family, heart), overcome family confrontations, economic problems, and issues with cohabitants. It's a good day to attract affluence and abundance in business, give thanks for good crop climates, and hold sacred curing ceremonies.</p>

                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>People born under Kawoq are connected to the weather and can feel it in their bodies. They are balanced, calm, loving, tender, and nurturing, possessing a strong constitution. They are also imaginative and home-loving. Stanzione (2006) describes them as stormy people directly affected by weather changes. When they become 'Sustenance and Water' intercessors, their lives are aligned; they connect with weather intuitively and physically. They are balanced, calm, loving, tender, and very nurturing people who can become midwives and Aj Q'ij. They are fecund with strong constitutions, very much part of the 'elements' as well as humanity, and can become successful farmers, weather forecasters, fishermen, and weavers.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Potential negative traits for Kawoq individuals include drunkenness and hatred of themselves and others; they may also be punished by the ancestors. Tedlock (1982) suggests a child born on Kawoq will have a troubled and harassed life full of ancestral punishment, lacking the strength to help others and thus unsuitable for diviner training. Stanzione (2006) notes that if not aligned as 'Sustenance and Water' intercessors, they can fall into drunkenness and self/other-hatred.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“In divination for an illness, Cawuk would indicate that someone set a table (<em>remelic tiquilic</em>) of offerings before the Mundo and the ancestors, asking them to send the illness to the client. The higher the number, the longer ago and the more serious the result of this request. However, in divining for the outcome of a business deal, "the table is set" (<em>remelic tiquilic</em>) indicates that the Mundo and the ancestors approve and that the proposed business deal is a good one.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“On 1 and 8 Cawuk, permission days for the novice daykeeper, the teacher reminds the student that the rituals have already begun and that the offerings have now been placed on the table of the Mundo (<em>remelic tiquilic</em>) in their name. On 1, 6, 8, and 9 Cawuk, daykeepers visit the shrines in order to place offerings on the table of the Mundo, as well as to ask that any troubles (<em>mulom kuchum</em>) placed there by their enemies be returned to those same enemies.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                                <p>Ajpu, meaning "one blow-gunner" or "deer hunter," also represents the sun and hero. The glyph for Ajpu is Ajaw, signifying the radiant sun, a manifestation of "kinh" (day), the root of time, and a flower; this day symbolizes triumph over problems and difficulties. Stanzione (2006) describes Ajpu as a hunter of animals, walker of roads, guardian of water-mountains, and Lord of Maize, associated with the Southlands and the yellow of abundance. Ajpu is maize incarnate, the sacrificed lord who returns from the dead, his skull like a seed buried before rain, resurrecting as a sprout in the moist heat of spring. As "First-Father," Ajpu is the end and beginning of the twenty sacred day cycle, where all is one in sacredness ("k'u") descending like dew on young maize plants. </p>
                                <p>It is a good day to ask for fecundity, patience, and gratitude for life's offerings, a flowery day of thanksgiving with nothing to fear. "Ajaw" is a day to ask for life amidst constant threats of death and to give thanks for life's gift. It is a memory of all preceding sacred days, the flowering and fruition of the Lords guiding us, a day to ask for forgiveness for human errors and for soul-strengthening power. Barrios (2015) states this day is for obtaining certainty and security, planning and managing goals. It's a day of renewal, expressing gratitude, asking for female fertility, emotional security, and increased intellect. It is the day of strength, courage, and life energy, especially for overcoming obstacles and achieving objectives.</p>
                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                                <h5>Favorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>People born on Ajpu are courageous, honest, and wise, often community leaders who sacrifice themselves for the good of the whole. They are visionaries, great walkers, athletic, talented craftsmen, and creative artists. They are also talented hunters and agriculturists, bountiful providers, and good problem solvers, making them good day keepers and diviners. They are strong both physically and spiritually and have a strong relationship with the dead. Stanzione (2006) describes them as courageous, honest, kind, wise, and sensitive to life, great walkers, creative artists, talented craftsmen, and good, victorious, happy intercessors that make great Aj Q'ij and diviners. They are statesmen willing to sacrifice for the whole, deadly hunters, and blessed agriculturalists, making them bountiful providers. Due to their communication ability, they are good problem-solvers. They can become great leaders, musicians, artists, dancers, singers, writers, communicators, politicians, merchants, and hunters.</p>
                                <h5>Unfavorable Aspects</h5>
                                    <p>Potential negative traits for Ajpu individuals include being predatory, angry, and vengeful. They may not accept advice, might avoid responsibility, and can be single-minded. Tedlock (1982) notes a child born on Junajpu (Ajpu) will have a close, possibly unhealthy, relationship with the dead, and may even become an "ajnawal mesa" (medium for voices of the dead). Stanzione (2006) mentions that when confronted by obstacles, they are easily frustrated, and their predatory nature can make them angry and vengeful.</p>
                            <h4>Divination</h4>
                                <p>“Junajpu days, like Aj days, are selected for house-building rituals; the priest-shaman specifically asks if the ancestors know (<em>quetaman ri Nantat</em>) and if they are in agreement concerning the new house. Junajpu days are also selected for the prayers and offerings that enable the spirit (<em>nawal</em>) of a dead person to enter the cold, dark room of the Mundo and thus join the other spirits. The younger and less powerful the person, the lower the number chosen. For example, the spirit of a baby enters the room on 1 Junajpu, a young married woman or man enter respectively on 5 and 6 Junajpu, while an old woman enters on 8 Junajpu and an old man on 9 Junajpu. A woman who has served as a midwife and/or daykeeper enters on 9 Junajpu, while a male priest-shaman enters from 9 to 12 Junajpu, depending on how high up in the priestly hierarchy he went. A person who has been town priest-shaman or second city manager enters on 12 Junajpu, and the powerful and capricious <em>ajnawal mesa</em> enters on 13 Junajpu.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>
                            <h4>Rituals</h4>
                                <p>“1 and 8 Junajpu are permission days for a novice daykeeper. On 1, 6, 8, and 9 Junajpu, individual daykeepers make offerings at the communal shrines before the ancestors (<em>chiquiwäch ri Nantat</em>). On 11 Junajpu, the town priest-shaman from Los Cipréses visits Socop, the sacred western mountain of the ancestors. Here he asks the ancestors for blessings (rather than the illnesses they can also send) for all living Momostecans.” (Tedlock, 1982)</p>

        <h2>The Mayan Cross</h2>
        <p>According to Molesky-Poz (2005), three signs interpret a person’s life: the birthdate and the dates nine days before and after, which represent their past and future. Molesky-Poz’s consultant reports, “This constellation tells us how to understand this person, the way he expresses himself, his characteristics. [...] Through this consultation, we are giving the person a schema for his life. There is an order for his life. [...] Following this blueprint, making offerings, paying on the first days will make this person happy. We are sure this is a direct form, one direct form within the cosmos to live in harmony, and to remember, to give back to the cosmos. You see in each of our day constellations, there is the Plumed Serpent.”</p>
	    <p>“The three days: one’s birth date, the day of the past, and the day of the future, influence one the most. The other six days are helpers. [...] It is within this map you find your vocation, your partner, your social organization. You see, embedded in the calendar is the Plumed Serpent. The calendar is one of its manifestations.”</p>
	    <p>Another consultant says. “We have to accept ourselves as we are. When I look at the calendar, then I can understand myself as I am and others as they are. I cannot criticize another person because every person carries abilities and weaknesses. In our communities we accept others in a very natural way. Parents know this child will be a businessperson or this girl will be a good healer. Only parents know it but we don’t talk about it. It is just part of life. In this way we respect it because we know each one has a work on earth. So we have to serve and respect elders because they have to complete their work. This is mutual respect and support." </p>
	    <p>“Every person is a specialist in what they need to do. As you know  your day and your capacities, you live out of that potential. You perfect yourself and your service to humanity. Then when we leave this life, we will have left this life satisfied that we have completed our work.”</p>
        <p>Once you have your Chol Q’ij date, check out the descriptions of each day below, making sure to incorporate the personality-modifying numbers. You can then calculate your Maya Cross - the larger context of the birthdate, the past, and future, as well as the “hemispheres” on the left and right and the four “helpers” on the corners. These create a grid of nine, by calculating forward and backward seven days from each of those three.</p>
        <p>Investigating the personality of each of these dates may help a person discover more about themselves and their lot in life. You can use this <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=dDM5bHI0MGRmaHY4M2E3ZmNuN3FhNXE2dTBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ">Google Calendar</a> to find the date (search the date like “8 Imox” - dates will populate starting in about 2018). You can also use the Google Calendar to find when the next iteration of your Chol Q’ij “birthday” occurs so you can celebrate it if you desire. </p>
