      <h2>A warning from the Maya ancestors <br>regarding the Chol Q’ij:</h2>
        <p>Do not investigate the Chol Q’ij for simple curiosity, entertainment, or vanity. <br>On the contrary, its use must carry with it the intended purpose of orienting one’s physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual development.</p>

      <h1 id="title">What is the Chol Q'ij?</h1>
        <p>The Chol Q’ij is the sacred 260 day calendar of the Maya people in the Highlands of Guatemala. Chol Q’ij is K’iche for “count of days”; it is also called the Tzolk’in in Yucateco. It can also be referred to as the “Highland Sacred Round”.</p>
        <p>The Chol Q’ij is often envisioned as two gears moving together, one of twenty “named” days and one of thirteen accompanying numbers. The first day of the cycle is 8 B’atz (celebrated as a secondary “New Year”), the second is 9 E’, the third is 10 Aj, and so on, so that each of the 260 days has its own unique combination of a number and day name. </p>
    <div class="cq_rotating_gears imagecontainer">
        <img src="images/chol qij.png" width="500px" alt="Two gears labeled with the thirteen numbers and twenty day names. The arrows on each indicate they are rotating together."/>
        <figcaption>The Chol Q'ij numbers and day names, envisioned as gears.</figcaption>
    </div>
    <div class="cq_explanation">
        <aside> The 20 day names are Imox, Iq', Aq'ab'al, K'at, Kan, Kame, Kej, Q'anil, Toj, Tz'i', B'atz', E', Aj, I'x, Tz'ikin, Ajmaq, No'j, Tijax, Kawoq, and Ajpu.</aside>
        <p>In the Chol Q’ij, each of the twenty named days has a personality or character that is tempered or strengthened by the number of the day. According to Tedlock’s (1992) informants, low numbers (1-3) are gentle and indicate something young or new, and the high numbers (11-13) are powerful or violent, indicating more serious or “older” matters, but each number has layers of unique meaning beyond this (see “The Mayan Numbers” section for a full breakdown of Mayan numerology for digits 1-13). </p>
        <p>Initiated priests in this three-thousand-year-old tradition, called ajq’ija’ or “day-keepers” (singular aj q’ij), interpret each date of the Chol Q’ij calendar and determine which rituals or prayers to perform; the community members that continue to follow the old ways request dream interpretations, divinations regarding their futures, interpretations of the will of the spirits and ancestors, and advice on good days to hold weddings, plant crops, or start a new business (Molesky-Poz, 2006; Tedlock, 1992). </p>
        <p>12 No’j, for example, is the best day to propose or defend a project; as the last even number before a beginning a new cycle, 12 represents a summing up of one’s actions and experience, and No’j is the best day to join ideas, give advice, or cultivate science (Anonymous, aj q’ij, Kaqchikel Maya of Patzún, Chimaltenango, Guatemala, personal communication, April 2016).</p>
        <p>The Chol Q’ij also holds astrological value on an individual level. Much like the Western concept of astrology, children are said to develop certain personalities and characteristics depending on the day that they were born. However, unlike Western astrology, this is not based on the location of the planets in certain quadrants of the sky at the moment of birth, but rather the confluence of the energies and rhythms of Mayan time that converge at the moment of conception and manifest at the moment of birth. </p>
        <p>For instance, children born on the day 9 No’j would be innovative thinkers, patient, curious, self-sufficient, and idealistic about justice, but stubborn and independent to a fault (Tedlock, 1992; Barrios, 2015). Most people in the highlands of Guatemala know their Chol Q’ij birthday and that of their children; many children are given traditional Maya names based on their birthday. These energies are concieved of as a guide or Ruwäch Q'ij ("the heart of the day") that for those who permit themselves to know it can give meaning to life and become a profound influence. </p>
        <br>

    <div class="cq_explanation">
        <h2>The Ruwäch Q'ij</h2>
        <p>Mesoamerican traditionalists believe that the personality traits indicated by one’s birth date on the Chol Q’ij are embodied in a kindred animal spirit that accompanies, protects, and guides a person through life (García et al., 2009; Gonzalez, 2011; Shea, 2001). According to Gonzalez (2011), those who subscribe to this idea generally believe that the human and their animal counterpart share a soul, though cultural groups disagree on whether the animal is a physical entity, a metaphor, or a literal spirit that accompanies the person through their life. This animal, called the ruwäch q'ij (the heart of the day) in Kaqchikel or the nahual in Nahuatl, embodies their personality, their occupation, and their destiny. 
        <p>"The nahual or ruwäch q'ij ("the heart or fruit of the day") can be understood as a gift, mission, vocation, or innate quality that you bring with you at your birth to help you. That is today, accepting the mission enters a person into correspondence and compatibility with the universe. The service of the gift given to you by nature blesses you with much satisfaction in your life, permits you to achieve the function that you possess, and understand that each person is a small but complementary part of the universe." (pg 225, Ruxe’el Mayab’ K’aslemal. Raiz espiritu del conocimiento maya, translation mine). </p>
        <p>To know the identity of ruwäch aq’ij (the heart of <em>your</em> day) is taken as tacit acceptance of the mission set by it, and to accept the mission is to begin to walk the path that the gods and ancestors have laid out for you and to be blessed with satisfaction in your life. (García et al., 2009). The Kaqchikel believe that all the world has a ruwäch q'ij but only certain people are privileged to identify its species. </p>
        <p>Each of the 20 day names on the Chol Q'ij corresponds to at least one unique animal; some days have a variety, to allow for personality and personal choice. The nature of one’s ruwäch q’ij and thus one’s soul is to be kept secret; however, traditional Mayan names give away the nature of the ruwäch q’ij (such as Wuqu’ I’x having a jaguar, or Ixkame an owl) to those who are “in the know'' such as elders and daykeepers. In some areas, it is believed that those that know the form of ruwäch kiq’ij (the face of their day) may be able to take its form and shapeshift, flying like a bird, leaping over barriers, or performing tasks that would not be possible in human form (Shea, 2001).</p>
        <p>Whether the animal is literal or spirit, it is thought possible to physically interact with it and even to harm it if you know its name. Those who believe this version know that when something bad happens to the ruwäch q’ij, there is a corresponding repercussion for their human. As such, elders and community members keep the identity of the ruwäch q’ij a secret from a child until they are older. This also serves the benefit of keeping children from imitating their animal spirits artificially so that they instead will develop traits and characteristics naturally. Accordingly, “an individual may be aggressive or passive, nervous or calm, outgoing or shy, flamboyant or retiring, mischievous or serious, graceful or clumsy, all depending on the nature of the animal spirit (Shea, 2001; pg 55)”.</p>

                    <h3>1 Jun</h3>
                    <p>The number 1 in the Chol Q'ij often signifies <strong>beginnings, unity, and potent focus</strong>. It is the spark of creation, the initial impulse from which all else unfolds.</p>
                    <p>Consider it a day for initiating new projects, clarifying intentions, and standing independently in your purpose.</p>
                    <h4>Key Themes for Jun:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unity</li>
                        <li>Initiation</li>
                        <li>Potential</li>
                        <li>Originality</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Position</h4>
                    <p>Jun is a low and odd number, which usually represents something challenging. However, the seed can grow into a mighty tree, it is full of potential. It needs the correct nutrients and conditions to germinate and develop its potential. We also may need encouragement to develop our ideas.</p>
                    <p>Daykeepers usually do rituals on a 1 day, and in some traditional communities there is a special shrine dedicated to the number 1.</p>
                    <h4>Effect</h4>
                    <p>Trustful and independent. Do not expect a jun person to be bothered with the details or to bring the final touch to things. The Jun is more efficient when confronted with a challenge.</p>
                `,
                2: `
                    <h3>2 Ka'i'</h3>
                    <p>Ka'i' brings themes of <strong>duality, partnership, and important choices</strong>. It highlights relationships, cooperation, and the balance of opposing forces.</p>
                    <p>This day may ask you to consider different perspectives or to work collaboratively. Decisions made on a '2' day can have significant relational impacts.</p>
                    <h4>Key Themes for Ka'i'</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Duality</li>
                        <li>Partnership</li>

                        <li>Cooperation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Position</h4>
                    <p>Although a low number, it has surprising strength. It is said to be able to call upon both aspects or polarities of what it is attached to. It is said to be the number of lovers, it signifies relationships and self-sacrifice.</p>
                    <h4>Effect</h4>
                    <p>The energy of ka’i’ is to always consider the positive from the negative and to progress in a well balanced way through the different choices to be made, light/darkness, male/female, right/wrong, Yin/Yang. The energy of ka’i’ finds its reason to be by experimenting with differences. Whilst it can lend itself to mediation, seeing both sides of the story, it also can be indecisive.</p>

                    <h3>3: Oxi'</h3>
                    <p>Oxi' relates to <strong>rhythm, action, and the sacred hearth or home</strong>. It signifies creative expression, movement, and the coming together of energies.</p>
                    <p>Oxi’ represents the 3 hearthstones of the Maya home, on the fire supporting the tortilla griddle. From an astronomical point of view, the stones are the stars Alnitak, Saiph and Rigel in the constellation we call Orion, and the Smoky Fireplace is the Great Orion Nebula (M42). The Number 3 relates to the three worlds of the Mayan cosmovision – Heaven, Earth, and the Underworld.</p>
                    <p>It's a dynamic number that can bring activity and the need for clear communication within family or groups.</p>
                    <h4>Key Themes for Oxi'</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Action and rhythm</li>
                        <li>Home</li>

                        <li>Communication</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Position</h4>
                    <p>The number 3 is still in the low end of the range of numbers. It does not have much energy yet, and it is also an odd number.</p>
                    <h4>Effect</h4>
                    <p>it lacks stability and can represent challenges and obstructions. The number three brings up internal/external dilemmas. The lack of stability in the physical, external world that it brings suggests that the more appropriate action is to look to the internal world, both of the home and yourself.</p> 
                    <p>The energy of oxi’ is very eloquent through all forms of personal expression. The communication purpose is to establish a consensus between any point A and any point B. Since the basic movement is vibration, the oxi’ person is in the very core of the rhythm; often agitated, movement being their very nature. By working closely to the energy of the 3, anyone can foretell whatever movement. But 3 can be a difficult number nevertheless. Carl Jung, objecting to the notion of a Trinity, said that the number 3 is incomplete. The Maya would agree. This is a difficult number, and implies doubt, risk, uncertainty. Many traditional Daykeepers avoid initiating new projects on a 3 day.</p>

                    <h3>4: Kaji'</h3>
                    <p>Kaji' represents <strong>stability, foundation, and the four cardinal directions or pillars</strong>. It is a number of order, structure, and practical manifestation.</p>
                    <p>Four represents the cardinal points, the four colours of maize, the four carriers of the year, the two equinoxes and two solstices, as well as midnight, sunrise, midday and sunset. These four components of each day, each “sun,” can be conceptually expanded to include the solstices and equinoxes; thus the year is also a 4. There is evidence that the Classic Maya divided the universe into four sections marked by the two intersections of the Milky Way with the ecliptic. Thus we live in a fourfold universe. The Maya still lay out their ritual altars in a fourfold pattern. The number four is representative of the four first men. It was said to be they who raised the sky from the sea to create the world we live in. In Mayan myth it is four pillars that support the sky from the Earth. As you can imagine, kaji’ is a number which represents stability, a good, down-to-Earth number.</p>
                    <p>A day for building, organizing, and attending to the material aspects of life.</p>

                    <p>Wo'o is often associated with <strong>empowerment, the center, and the human hand (work and action)</strong>. It's a pivotal number that can represent the core of a matter or the application of will.</p>
                    <p>Wo’o’ is the four cardinal directions plus the center point. The Sacred Mayan calendar is said to be a calendar of human life. It can be seen as a microcosm of the human body. The number five is one of these parts. It is representative of the hand with its five digits. It is with our hands that we work, and with what we earn we pay our debts, so this is the number of work, the actions that we perform in life. Wo’o’ is also a number that relates to the sacred fire where we pay our debts with offerings and prayers.</p>
                    <p>This day can be for taking charge, focusing energy, and accomplishing tasks.</p>
                    <h4>Key Themes for Wo'o</h4>

Wo’o’ is an intelligent force that organizes communications, materials, knowledge and their application. By nature the wo’o’ people deal with networks and gather what they need. These persons go straight to the crux of any situation which makes excellent investigators out of them.</p>

                    <p>Waqi' brings themes of <strong>balance, flow, and organization within a system</strong>. It can refer to family harmony, responsibilities, and the need for equilibrium.</p>
                    <p>The number waqi’ carries the qualities of the number 4, but has an extra axis.

        <h2>The Mayan Cross</h2>
        <p>According to Molesky-Poz (2005), three signs interpret a person’s life: the birthdate and the dates nine days before and after, which represent their past and future. Molesky-Poz’s consultant reports, “This constellation tells us how to understand this person, the way he expresses himself, his characteristics. [...] Through this consultation, we are giving the person a schema for his life. There is an order for his life. [...] Following this blueprint, making offerings, paying on the first days will make this person happy. We are sure this is a direct form, one direct form within the cosmos to live in harmony, and to remember, to give back to the cosmos. You see in each of our day constellations, there is the Plumed Serpent.”</p>
	    <p>“The three days: one’s birth date, the day of the past, and the day of the future, influence one the most. The other six days are helpers. [...] It is within this map you find your vocation, your partner, your social organization. You see, embedded in the calendar is the Plumed Serpent. The calendar is one of its manifestations.”</p>
	    <p>Another consultant says. “We have to accept ourselves as we are. When I look at the calendar, then I can understand myself as I am and others as they are. I cannot criticize another person because every person carries abilities and weaknesses. In our communities we accept others in a very natural way. Parents know this child will be a businessperson or this girl will be a good healer. Only parents know it but we don’t talk about it. It is just part of life. In this way we respect it because we know each one has a work on earth. So we have to serve and respect elders because they have to complete their work. This is mutual respect and support." </p>
	    <p>“Every person is a specialist in what they need to do. As you know  your day and your capacities, you live out of that potential. You perfect yourself and your service to humanity. Then when we leave this life, we will have left this life satisfied that we have completed our work.”</p>
        <p>Once you have your Chol Q’ij date, check out the descriptions of each day below, making sure to incorporate the personality-modifying numbers. You can then calculate your Maya Cross - the larger context of the birthdate, the past, and future, as well as the “hemispheres” on the left and right and the four “helpers” on the corners. These create a grid of nine, by calculating forward and backward seven days from each of those three.</p>
        <p>Investigating the personality of each of these dates may help a person discover more about themselves and their lot in life. You can use this <a href=https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=dDM5bHI0MGRmaHY4M2E3ZmNuN3FhNXE2dTBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ>Google Calendar</a> to find the date (search the date like “8 Imox” - dates will populate starting in about 2018). You can also use the Google Calendar to find when the next iteration of your Chol Q’ij “birthday” occurs so you can celebrate it if you desire. </p>
