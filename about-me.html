      <section>
        <p>
          I'm Emmett Speed (he/they), an enthusiastic advocate for enhancing
          math education. I have a
          <strong>Ph.D. in Educational Neuroscience</strong>
          from Utah State University and over
          <strong
            >10 years of experience in educational research and program
            management</strong
          >. I am passionate about making a difference in education and am
          committed to using my research and practical skills to create more
          effective and equitable learning experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          My research focuses on numerical cognition within linguistically and
          culturally diverse communities, with a focus on how language and
          culture shape mathematical learning, particularly among Indigenous
          populations. This work has allowed me to explore various facets of
          education, including
          <strong
            >education policy, curriculum analysis, educational assessment,
            learning theory, and neurobiology</strong
          >. My dissertation, &quot;An Exploratory Study of the Vertical SNARC
          Effect in Mayan Numerals: Effects of Language Transparency and Reading
          Direction&quot;, involved teaching the Mayan number system to
          investigate the impact of unfamiliar numerical systems on cognitive
          processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond research, I have practical experience in program management and
          data analysis. As the Program Manager - Data and Evaluation Lead at
          the Utah STEM Action Center, I led initiatives like the AmeriCorps
          Math Mentor Program, contributing to significant positive impacts on
          children's math achievement. I have a
          <strong
            >proven track record of developing databases, streamlining workflow,
            managing research projects, and securing grant funding</strong
          >. My colleagues know me as a "spreadsheet wizard" with a knack for
          problem-solving and a collaborative spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I volunteer with Habitat for Humanity and the
          International Rescue Committee, play Dungeons & Dragons, cross-stitch
          lots of floral patterns, watch Star Trek: Deep Space Nine over and
          over again, and spend as much time as possible on a snowboard.
