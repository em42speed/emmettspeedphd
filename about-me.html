      <p>
        I'm Emmett Speed (he/they), an enthusiastic advocate for enhancing math education and a Ph.D. candidate in Educational Neuroscience from Utah State University (defending 5/19/2025). I have over <strong style="color:hsla(268, 30%, 63%, 1);">10 years of experience in educational research and program management</strong>. I am passionate about making a difference in education and am committed to using my research and practical skills to create more effective and equitable learning experiences.
      </p>
      <p>  
        My research focuses on numerical cognition within linguistically and culturally diverse communities, with a focus on how language and culture shape mathematical learning, particularly among Indigenous populations. This work has allowed me to explore various facets of education, including <strong style="color:hsla(268, 30%, 63%, 1);">education policy, curriculum analysis, educational assessment, learning theory, and neurobiology</strong>. My dissertation, "The SNARC Effect in Mayan Numerals: Effects of Language Transparency and Reading Direction on Novel Symbolic Number Understanding", involved teaching the Mayan number system to investigate the impact of unfamiliar numerical systems on cognitive processing.
      </p>
      <p>
      Beyond research, I have practical experience in program management and data analysis. As the Program Manager - Data and Evaluation Lead at the Utah STEM Action Center, I led initiatives like the AmeriCorps Math Mentor Program, contributing to significant positive impacts on children's lives. I have a <strong style="color:hsla(268, 30%, 63%, 1);">proven track record of developing databases, streamlining workflow, managing research projects, and securing grant funding</strong>. My colleagues know me as a "spreadsheet wizard" with a knack for problem-solving and a collaborative spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I volunteer with Habitat for Humanity and the International Rescue Committee, play Dungeons & Dragons, cross-stitch lots of floral patterns, watch Star Trek: Deep Space Nine over and over again, and spend as much time as possible on a snowboard.
      </p>
